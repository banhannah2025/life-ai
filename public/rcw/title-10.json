The legislature also recognizes that tribes have, for decades, agreed by treaty and through practice not to shelter or conceal those individuals who violate state law and to surrender them to the state for prosecution. In the interests of public safety and partnership, it is therefore the intent of the legislature to create uniform processes by which the state may consistently reciprocate with tribes the return of those individuals who violate tribal law and seek to avoid tribal justice systems by leaving tribal jurisdiction.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">The legislature further recognizes it is a constitutional imperative that individuals alleged to have violated criminal laws are afforded the fullest protections of due process including, but not limited to: (1) The right to effective assistance of counsel at least equal to that guaranteed by the United States Constitution; (2) the right of an indigent defendant to the assistance of a licensed defense attorney, at the expense of the tribal government; (3) the right to a criminal proceeding presided over by a judge who is licensed to practice law and has sufficient legal training; (4) the right to have access, prior to being charged, to the tribe's criminal laws, rules of evidence, and rules of criminal procedure; and (5) the right to a record of the criminal proceeding, including an audio or other recording of the trial proceeding. The legislature finds that numerous federally recognized tribes with territory inside the state have systems and processes recognized by the federal government as providing due process to defendants at least equal to those required by the United States Constitution. The legislature also finds that all defendants in tribal courts have the right to petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">The legislature additionally recognizes the importance of establishing clear statutory duties when directing peace officers of this state to effectuate new aspects of their work. It is the intent of the legislature that chapter 207, Laws of 2024 set forth procedures by which peace officers and correctional staff of this state must recognize and effectuate tribal arrest warrants.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">Therefore, the legislature declares the purpose of chapter 207, Laws of 2024 is to expand cross-jurisdictional cooperation so that fugitives from tribal courts cannot evade justice by remaining off reservation in Washington's counties and cities, while ensuring that defendants receive the fullest due process protections<span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">.</span></div>",

While their conduct is not typical of the vast majority of persons with developmental disabilities who are responsible citizens, for their own welfare and for the safety of others the state may need to exercise control over those few dangerous individuals who are developmentally disabled, have been charged with crimes that involve a threat to public safety or security, and have been found either incompetent to stand trial or not guilty by reason of insanity. The legislature finds, however, that the use of civil commitment procedures under chapter  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=71.05\">71.05</a> RCW to effect state control over dangerous developmentally disabled persons has resulted in their commitment to institutions for the mentally ill. The legislature finds that existing programs in mental institutions may be inappropriate for persons who are developmentally disabled because the services provided in mental institutions are oriented to persons with mental illness, a condition not necessarily associated with developmental disabilities. Therefore, the legislature believes that, where appropriate, and subject to available funds, persons with developmental disabilities who have been charged with crimes that involve a threat to public safety or security and have been found incompetent to stand trial or not guilty by reason of insanity should receive state services addressing their needs, that such services must be provided in conformance with an individual habilitation plan, and that their initial treatment should be separate and discrete from treatment for persons involved in any other treatment or habilitation program in a manner consistent with the needs of public safety.</div>",

If the prosecuting attorney proves by a preponderance of the evidence that there is a compelling state interest in ordering competency restoration treatment, then the court shall issue an order in accordance with subsection (2) of this section.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(2)(a) If a court finds pursuant to subsection (1)(b) of this section that there is a compelling state interest in pursuing competency restoration treatment, the court shall order the defendant to receive outpatient competency restoration consistent with the recommendation of the forensic navigator, unless the court finds that an order for outpatient competency restoration is inappropriate considering the health and safety of the defendant and risks to public safety.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(b) To be eligible for an order for outpatient competency restoration, a defendant must be willing to:</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(i) Adhere to medications or receive prescribed intramuscular medication;</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(ii) Abstain from alcohol and unprescribed drugs; and</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(iii) Comply with urinalysis or breathalyzer monitoring if needed.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(c) If the court orders inpatient competency restoration, the department shall place the defendant in an appropriate facility of the department for competency restoration under subsection (3) of this section.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(d) If the court orders outpatient competency restoration, the court shall modify conditions of release as needed to authorize the department to place the person in approved housing, which may include access to supported housing, affiliated with a contracted outpatient competency restoration program. The department, in conjunction with the health care authority, must establish rules for conditions of participation in the outpatient competency restoration program, which must include the defendant being subject to medication management. The court may order regular urinalysis testing. The outpatient competency restoration program shall monitor the defendant during the defendant's placement in the program and report any noncompliance or significant changes with respect to the defendant to the department and, if applicable, the forensic navigator.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(e) If a defendant fails to comply with the restrictions of the outpatient competency restoration program such that restoration is no longer appropriate in that setting or the defendant is no longer clinically appropriate for outpatient competency restoration, the director of the outpatient competency restoration program shall notify the authority and the department of the need to terminate the outpatient competency restoration placement and intent to request placement for the defendant in an appropriate facility of the department for inpatient competency restoration. The outpatient competency restoration program shall coordinate with the authority, the department, and any law enforcement personnel under (e)(i) of this subsection to ensure that the time period between termination and admission into the inpatient facility is as minimal as possible. The time period for inpatient competency restoration shall be reduced by the time period spent in active treatment within the outpatient competency restoration program, excluding time periods in which the defendant was absent from the program and all time from notice of termination of the outpatient competency restoration period through the defendant's admission to the facility. The department shall obtain a placement for the defendant within seven days of the notice of intent to terminate the outpatient competency restoration placement.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(i) The department may authorize a peace officer to detain the defendant into emergency custody for transport to the designated inpatient competency restoration facility. If medical clearance is required by the designated competency restoration facility before admission, the peace officer must transport the defendant to a crisis stabilization unit, evaluation and treatment facility, or emergency department of a local hospital for medical clearance once a bed is available at the designated inpatient competency restoration facility. The signed outpatient competency restoration order of the court shall serve as authority for the detention of the defendant under this subsection. This subsection does not preclude voluntary transportation of the defendant to a facility for inpatient competency restoration or for medical clearance, or authorize admission of the defendant into jail.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(ii) The department shall notify the court and parties of the defendant's admission for inpatient competency restoration before the close of the next judicial day. The court shall schedule a hearing within five days to review the conditions of release of the defendant and anticipated release from treatment and issue appropriate orders.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(f) The court may not issue an order for outpatient competency restoration unless the department certifies that there is an available appropriate outpatient [competency] restoration program that has adequate space for the person at the time the order is issued or the court places the defendant under the guidance and control of a professional person identified in the court order.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(g) If the court does not order the defendant to receive outpatient competency restoration under (a) of this subsection, the court shall commit the defendant to the department for placement in a facility operated or contracted by the department for inpatient competency restoration.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(3) The placement under subsection (2) of this section shall not exceed 29 days if the defendant is ordered to receive inpatient competency restoration, and shall not exceed 90 days if the defendant is ordered to receive outpatient competency restoration. The court may order any combination of this subsection, but the total period of inpatient competency restoration may not exceed 29 days.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(4) Beginning October 1, 2023, if the defendant is charged with a serious traffic offense under RCW  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.94A.030\">9.94A.030</a>, the court may order the clerk to transmit an order to the department of licensing for revocation of the defendant's driver's license for a period of one year. The court shall direct the clerk to transmit an order to the department of licensing reinstating the defendant's driver's license if the defendant is subsequently restored to competency, and may do so at any time before the end of one year for good cause upon the petition of the defendant.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(5) If the court has determined or the parties agree that the defendant is unlikely to regain competency, the court may dismiss the charges without prejudice without ordering the defendant to undergo competency restoration treatment, in which case the court shall order that the defendant be referred for evaluation for civil commitment in the manner provided in subsection (6) of this section.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(6)(a) If the proceedings are dismissed under *RCW  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=10.77.635\">10.77.635</a> and the defendant was on conditional release at the time of dismissal, the court shall order the designated crisis responder within that county to evaluate the defendant pursuant to chapter  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=71.05\">71.05</a> RCW. The evaluation may be conducted in any location chosen by the professional.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(b) If the defendant was in custody and not on conditional release at the time of dismissal, the defendant shall be detained and sent to an evaluation and treatment facility for up to 120 hours if the defendant has not undergone competency restoration services or has engaged in outpatient competency restoration services and up to 72 hours if the defendant engaged in inpatient competency restoration services, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays, for evaluation for purposes of filing a petition under chapter  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=71.05\">71.05</a> RCW.

The court must give notice to all parties at least 24 hours before the dismissal of any proceeding under this subsection, and provide an opportunity for a hearing on whether to dismiss the proceedings.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(8) If at any time the court dismisses charges under subsections (1) through (7) of this section, the court shall make a finding as to whether the defendant has a history of one or more violent acts. If the court so finds, the court shall issue an order prohibiting the defendant from the possession of firearms until a court restores his or her right to possess a firearm under RCW  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.047\">9.41.047</a>. The court shall notify the defendant orally and in writing that the defendant may not possess a firearm unless the defendant's right to do so is restored by the superior court that issued the order under RCW  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.047\">9.41.047</a>, and that the defendant must immediately surrender all firearms and any concealed pistol license to their local law enforcement agency.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(9) Any period of competency restoration treatment under this section includes only the time the defendant is actually at the facility or is actively participating in an outpatient competency restoration program and is in addition to reasonable time for transport to or from the facility.</div>",

The legislature further finds that bringing persons or organizations committing crimes in Washington to justice is a matter of great public interest because crimes have a significant effect on businesses, associations, and other organizations that conduct business in Washington, as well as on Washington citizens. Crimes result in significant harm and losses to persons, businesses, associations, and other organizations victimized, as well as persons not directly victimized when businesses or others more directly affected by the crimes must raise prices to cover crime losses. The ability of law enforcement and the criminal justice system to effectively perform their duties to the public often depends upon law enforcement agencies, prosecutors, and criminal defense attorneys being able to obtain and use records relevant to crimes that affect Washington's citizens, businesses, associations, organizations, and others who provide goods or services, or conduct other activity in Washington. In the course of fulfilling their duties to the public, law enforcement agencies, prosecutors, and criminal defense attorneys must frequently obtain records from these entities, and be able to use the records in court. The ability to obtain and use these records has an impact on Washington citizens because it affects the ability to enforce Washington's criminal laws and affects the deterrence value arising from criminal prosecution. Effectively combating crime requires laws facilitating and requiring that all those who possess records relevant to a criminal investigation comply with the legal process issued in connection with criminal investigations or litigation.</div>",

The legislature finds that the existing criminal statutes are adequate to provide protection for victims of domestic violence. However, previous societal attitudes have been reflected in policies and practices of law enforcement agencies and prosecutors which have resulted in differing treatment of crimes occurring between cohabitants and of the same crimes occurring between strangers. Only recently has public perception of the serious consequences of domestic violence to society and to the victims led to the recognition of the necessity for early intervention by law enforcement agencies. It is the intent of the legislature that the official response to cases of domestic violence shall stress the enforcement of the laws to protect the victim and shall communicate the attitude that violent behavior is not excused or tolerated. Furthermore, it is the intent of the legislature that criminal laws be enforced without regard to whether the persons involved are or were married, cohabiting, or involved in a relationship.</div>",
