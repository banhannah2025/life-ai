However, through a series of decisions equating a \"corporation\" with a \"person,\" the U.S. supreme court extended to corporations the constitutional rights and protections intended for people only.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(4) Unlike human beings, corporations can exist in perpetuity and in many countries at the same time. As a result many large corporations, both foreign and domestic, invest in campaigns to invalidate or bypass regulatory law intended to protect the public. Thus, corporate participation in the political process often conflicts with the public interest.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(5) Money is property; it is not speech. Nowhere in the U.S. Constitution is money equated with speech. Because advertising is limited and costly, equating the spending of money with free speech gives those with the most money the most speech.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(6) Whenever special interests, including very wealthy individuals, are able to spend unlimited amounts of money on political speech, candidates and officeholders can be corrupted and intimidated, and the free speech of most citizens is drowned out and denied.
