While it is the intent of the legislature to grant permissive investment powers to state-chartered savings and loan associations, it does not intend these associations to abandon the residential financing market in Washington. It, therefore, finds that the powers granted in chapter 3, Laws of 1982 are for the purpose of updating and modernizing the law relating to savings and loan associations, thereby creating a more secure and responsive financial environment in which the residential homebuyer will continue to obtain financing.</div>",

One of the director of financial institutions certificates of authorization shall be attached to each of the certificates of reincorporation, and one set of these shall be filed and retained by the director of financial institutions, one set shall be filed in the office of the secretary of state, and one set shall be transmitted to the bank for its files. Upon the receipt from the corporation of the same fees as are required for filing and recording other incorporation certificates or articles, the secretary of state shall file the certificates and record the same; whereupon the conversion of the association shall be deemed complete, and the signers of said reincorporation certificate and their successors shall thereupon become and be a corporation having the powers and being subject to the duties and obligations prescribed by the laws of this state applicable to savings banks or commercial banks, as the case may be.
