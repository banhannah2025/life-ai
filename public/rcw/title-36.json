A peer review panel appointed by the Washington association of sheriffs and police chiefs in consultation with the law enforcement assisted diversion national support bureau, integrated managed care organizations and behavioral health organizations must review the grant applications. The peer review panel must include experts in harm reduction and civil rights experts.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(3)(a) Programs preferred for the award of grant funding are those that have a prebooking diversion focus and demonstrate how they will impact one or more of the expected outcomes of the grant program.

Grant recipients must agree to comply with any data collection and reporting requirements that are established by the Washington association of sheriffs and police chiefs in consultation with the law enforcement assisted diversion national support bureau. Grant recipients whose proposals include prebooking diversion programs must engage with the law enforcement assisted diversion national support bureau for technical assistance regarding best practices for prebooking diversion programs, and regarding establishment of an evaluation plan. Subject to appropriated funding, grant awards will be eligible for annual renewal conditioned upon the recipient's demonstration that the funded program is operating in alignment with the requirements for the grant program.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(6) The Washington association of sheriffs and police chiefs must ensure that grants awarded under this program are separate and distinct from grants awarded pursuant to RCW  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=36.28A.440\">36.28A.440</a>. Grant funds may not be used to fulfill minimum medical and treatment services that jails or community mental health agencies are legally required to provide.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(7) Once the Washington association of sheriffs and police chiefs, after consultation with the law enforcement assisted diversion national support bureau, certifies that a selected applicant satisfies the proposal criteria, the grant funds will be distributed. To the extent possible, grant awards should be geographically distributed on both the east and west sides of the crest of the Cascade mountain range. Grant applications that include local matching funds may be prioritized. Grant recipients must be selected no later than March 1, 2020.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(8)(a) The grant program under this section must be managed to achieve expected outcomes which are measurable and may be used in the future to evaluate the performance of grant recipients and hold them accountable for the use of funding. The initial expected outcomes defined for the grant program include:</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(i) To reduce arrests, time spent in custody, and/or recidivism for clients served by the program;</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(ii) To increase access to and utilization of nonemergency community behavioral health services;</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(iii) To reduce utilization of emergency services;</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(iv) To increase resilience, stability, and well-being for clients served; and</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(v) To reduce costs for the justice system compared to processing cases as usual through the justice system.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(b) Programs which apply for and are awarded grant funding may focus on a subset of these outcomes and may target a segment of an outcome, such as reducing time spent in custody but not arrests. The Washington association of sheriffs and police chiefs, in consultation with the law enforcement assisted diversion national support bureau, must develop a plan, timetable, and budget by December 1, 2019, to transition the grant program into a performance-based contracting format and to establish an evidence-based evaluation framework. The plan may include making reasonable modifications to the initial expected outcomes for use in grant contracts. Delivery of the plan to the governor and appropriate committees of the legislature may be combined with the annual report provided in subsection (9) of this section. The research and data division of the department of social and health services and Washington institute for public policy must provide technical support and consultation to support plan development as requested.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(9) The Washington association of sheriffs and police chiefs must submit an annual report regarding the grant program to the governor and appropriate committees of the legislature by December 1st of each year the program is funded.

The open spaces, park, recreation and community facilities within such county provide public recreation, aesthetic, conservation and educational opportunities and other services and benefits accessible to all of the residents of such county. The public health and safety facilities within such county provide protection to life and property throughout the county, are functionally inter-related and affect the health, safety and welfare of all the residents of such county. The stormwater control facilities within such county provide protection from stormwater damage for life and property throughout the county, generally require planning and development over the entire drainage basins, and affect the prosperity, interests and welfare of all the residents of such county. The highways within such county, whether under the general control of the county or the state or within the limits of any incorporated city or town, provide an inter-connected system for the convenient and efficient movement of people and goods within such county. The use of general county funds for the purpose of acquisition, development, construction, or improvement of open space, park, recreation and community facilities, public health and safety facilities, stormwater control facilities, or highways or to participate with any governmental agency to perform such purposes within such county pursuant to this chapter is hereby declared to be a strictly county purpose.</div>",

The notice must clearly state that the residence is within the proposed service area and must provide information on estimated rates or charges that may be imposed for the service.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">A county shall not provide on-site sewage system inspection, pumping services, or other maintenance or repair services under this section using county employees unless the on-site system is connected by a publicly owned collection system to the county's sewerage system, and the on-site system represents the first step in the sewage disposal process. Nothing in this section shall affect the authority of a state or local health officer to carry out their responsibilities under any other applicable law.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">A county may, as part of a system of sewerage established under this chapter, provide for, finance, and operate any of the facilities and services and may exercise the powers expressly authorized for county stormwater, flood control, pollution prevention, and drainage services and activities under chapters  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=36.89\">36.89</a>, 86.12, 86.13, and  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=86.15\">86.15</a> RCW.

Per agreement with a regional transit authority serving the counties participating in a district, the equity principle identified under this subsection may include using the combined district and regional transit authority revenues generated within a participating county to determine the distribution that proportionally benefits the county.

The plan submitted to the voters must provide cost estimates for each project, including reasonable contingency costs. Plans submitted to the voters must provide that the maximum amount possible of the funds raised will be used to fund projects in the plan, including environmental improvements and mitigation, and that administrative costs be minimized.

These improvements are repaid by a voluntary assessment on the property, secured by a county lien, and assigned to a capital provider for all the administrative aspects of billing, collecting, and enforcing the lien and without the accumulation of cost to the county and without the creation of a personal debt obligation to the property owner. The obligation is instead carried by the property and remains with the property until repaid, regardless of any potential transfer of property ownership.
