For the purposes of this agreement, the term \"states\" means the several states, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia, and all United States territorial possessions.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">The purpose of this compact is to provide for mutual assistance between the states entering into this compact in managing any emergency or disaster that is duly declared by the governor of the affected state or states, whether arising from natural disaster, technological hazard, man-made disaster, civil emergency aspects of resources shortages, community disorders, insurgency, or enemy attack.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">This compact shall also provide for mutual cooperation in emergency-related exercises, testing, or other training activities using equipment and personnel simulating performance of any aspect of the giving and receiving of aid by party states or subdivisions of party states during emergencies, such actions occurring outside actual declared emergency periods. Mutual assistance in this compact may include the use of the states' national guard forces, either in accordance with the national guard mutual assistance compact, or by mutual agreement between states.</div><div style=\"text-align:center;margin-top:4.5pt;\">ARTICLE II</div><div style=\"text-align:center;\">GENERAL IMPLEMENTATION</div><div style=\"margin-top:4.5pt;text-indent:0.5in;\">Each party state entering into this compact recognizes many emergencies transcend political jurisdictional boundaries and that intergovernmental coordination is essential in managing these and other emergencies under this compact. Each state further recognizes that there will be emergencies which require immediate access and present procedures to apply outside resources to make a prompt and effective response to the emergency. This is because few, if any, individual states have all the resources they may need in all types of emergencies or the capability of delivering resources to areas where emergencies exist.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">The prompt, full, and effective utilization of resources of the participating states, including any resources on hand or available from the federal government or any other source, that are essential to the safety, care, and welfare of the people in the event of any emergency or disaster declared by a party state, shall be the underlying principle on which all articles of this compact shall be understood.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">On behalf of the governor of each state participating in the compact, the legally designated state official who is assigned responsibility for emergency management will be responsible for formulation of the appropriate interstate mutual aid plans and procedures necessary to implement this compact.</div><div style=\"text-align:center;margin-top:4.5pt;\">ARTICLE III</div><div style=\"text-align:center;\">PARTY STATE RESPONSIBILITIES</div><div style=\"margin-top:4.5pt;text-indent:0.5in;\">(1) It shall be the responsibility of each party state to formulate procedural plans and programs for interstate cooperation in the performance of the responsibilities listed in this article. In formulating such plans, and in carrying them out, the party states, as is practical, shall:</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(a) Review individual state hazards analyses and, to the extent reasonably possible, determine all those potential emergencies the party states might jointly suffer, whether due to natural disaster, technological hazard, man-made disaster, emergency aspects of resource shortages, civil disorders, insurgency, or enemy attack;</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(b) Review party states' individual emergency plans and develop a plan which will determine the mechanism for the interstate management and provision of assistance concerning any potential emergency;</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(c) Develop interstate procedures to fill any identified gaps and to resolve any identified inconsistencies or overlaps in existing or developed plans;</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(d) Assist in warning communities adjacent to or crossing the state boundaries;</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(e) Protect and assure uninterrupted delivery of services, medicines, water, food, energy and fuel, search and rescue, and critical lifeline equipment, services, and resources, both human and material;</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(f) Inventory and set procedures for the interstate loan and delivery of human and material resources, together with procedures for reimbursement or forgiveness;</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(g) Provide, to the extent authorized by law, for temporary suspension of any statutes or ordinances that restrict the implementation of the responsibilities listed in this compact.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(2) The authorized representative of a party state may request assistance of another party state by contacting the authorized representative of that state. The provisions of this agreement shall only apply to requests for assistance made by and to authorized representatives. Requests may be verbal or in writing. If verbal, the request shall be confirmed in writing within thirty days of the verbal request. Requests shall provide the following information:</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(a) A description of the emergency services function for which assistance is needed, such as, but not limited to, fire services, law enforcement, emergency medical, transportation, communications, public works and engineering, building inspection, planning and information assistance, mass care, resource support, health and medical services, and search and rescue;</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(b) The amount and type of personnel, equipment, materials, and supplies needed, and a reasonable estimate of the length of time they will be needed;</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(c) The specific place and time for staging of the assisting party's response and a point of contact at that location.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(3) There shall be frequent consultation between state officials who have assigned emergency management responsibilities and other appropriate representatives of the party states with affected jurisdictions and the United States government, with free exchange of information, plans, and resource records relating to emergency capabilities.</div><div style=\"text-align:center;margin-top:4.5pt;\">ARTICLE IV</div><div style=\"text-align:center;\">LIMITATIONS</div><div style=\"margin-top:4.5pt;text-indent:0.5in;\">Any party state requested to render mutual aid or conduct exercises and training for mutual aid shall take such action as is necessary to provide and make available the resources covered by this compact in accordance with the terms of this compact.

Each party state shall afford to the emergency forces of any party state, while operating within its state limits under the terms and conditions of this compact, the same powers except that of arrest unless specifically authorized by the receiving state, duties, rights, and privileges as are afforded forces of the state in which they are performing emergency services. Emergency forces will continue under the command and control of their regular leaders, but the organizational units will come under the operational control of the emergency services authorities of the state receiving assistance. These conditions may be activated, as needed, only subsequent to a declaration of a state of emergency or disaster by the governor of the party state that is to receive assistance or commencement of exercises or training for mutual aid and shall continue so long as the exercise or training for mutual aid are in progress, the state of emergency or disaster remains in effect, or loaned resources remain in the receiving state or states, whichever is longer.</div><div style=\"text-align:center;margin-top:4.5pt;\">ARTICLE V</div><div style=\"text-align:center;\">LICENSES AND PERMITS</div><div style=\"margin-top:4.5pt;text-indent:0.5in;\">Whenever any person holds a license, certificate, or other permit issued by any state party to the compact evidencing the meeting of qualifications for professional, mechanical, or other skills, and when such assistance is requested by the receiving party state, such person shall be deemed licensed, certified, or permitted by the state requesting assistance to render aid involving such skill to meet a declared emergency or disaster, subject to such limitations and conditions as the governor of the requesting state may prescribe by executive order or otherwise.</div><div style=\"text-align:center;margin-top:4.5pt;\">ARTICLE VI</div><div style=\"text-align:center;\">LIABILITY</div><div style=\"margin-top:4.5pt;text-indent:0.5in;\">Officers or employees of a party state rendering aid in another state under this compact shall be considered agents of the requesting state for tort liability and immunity purposes; and no party state or its officers or employees rendering aid in another state under this compact shall be liable on account of any act or omission in good faith on the part of such forces while so engaged or on account of the maintenance or use of any equipment or supplies in connection therewith.

Supplementary agreements may comprehend, but shall not be limited to, provisions for evacuation and reception of injured and other persons and the exchange of medical, fire, police, public utility, reconnaissance, welfare, transportation and communications personnel, and equipment and supplies.</div><div style=\"text-align:center;margin-top:4.5pt;\">ARTICLE VIII</div><div style=\"text-align:center;\">COMPENSATION</div><div style=\"margin-top:4.5pt;text-indent:0.5in;\">Each party state shall provide for payment of compensation and death benefits to injured members of the emergency forces of that state and representatives of deceased members of such forces in case such members sustain injuries or are killed while rendering aid under this compact, in the same manner and on the same terms as if the injury or death were sustained within their own state.</div><div style=\"text-align:center;margin-top:4.5pt;\">ARTICLE IX</div><div style=\"text-align:center;\">REIMBURSEMENT</div><div style=\"margin-top:4.5pt;text-indent:0.5in;\">Any party state rendering aid in another state under this compact shall be reimbursed by the party state receiving the aid for any loss or damage to or expense incurred in the operation of any equipment and the provision of any service in answering a request for aid and for the costs incurred in connection with the requests. However, any aiding party state may assume in whole or in part the loss, damage, expense, or other cost, or may loan equipment or donate services to the receiving party state without charge or cost; and any two or more party states may enter into supplementary agreements establishing a different allocation of costs among those states. Article VIII expenses may not be reimbursable under this article.</div><div style=\"text-align:center;margin-top:4.5pt;\">ARTICLE X</div><div style=\"text-align:center;\">EVACUATION</div><div style=\"margin-top:4.5pt;text-indent:0.5in;\">Plans for the orderly evacuation and interstate reception of portions of the civilian population as the result of any emergency or disaster of sufficient proportions to so warrant, shall be worked out and maintained between the party states and the emergency management/services directors of the various jurisdictions where any type of incident requiring evacuation might occur.

Other defendants in military service also have protections against default judgments not covered by this notice. If you are the dependent of a member of the national guard or a military reserve component under a call to active service, or a national guard member under a call to service authorized by the governor of the state of Washington, for a period of more than thirty consecutive days, you should notify the plaintiff or the plaintiff's attorneys in writing of your status as such within twenty days of the receipt of this notice.

Requests to 911 and subsequent emergency response communications are managed by public safety telecommunicator professionals. These first responders are essential workers who continue public service throughout the pandemic, who are essential to triage requests for emergency responses and provide lifesaving instructions and guidance to those who call 911, ensuring the appropriate response for the situation; law enforcement, behavioral health, fire, and emergency medical. The public safety telecommunicator also dispatches, tracks, processes, and transmits information from the public and continually communicates with responders providing an additional layer of safety. The legislature takes special note of the contributions made by public safety telecommunicators whose tasks are arduous and whose working conditions may be contributing to the high and often critical turnover among the principal cadre of professionals who receive and process requests from the public for emergency response and provide emergency communications with public safety responders.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(2) The legislature also recognizes that public safety telecommunicators are the only public safety professionals who are not required to be certified and do not have standard initial training requirements to perform their critical public safety function. Further, employers of public safety telecommunicators face challenges in attracting suitable candidates, training, and retaining of staff due to the high demand and high stress environment of this critical public safety profession.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(3) The legislature finds and declares that:</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(a) Public safety telecommunicators must have a formal system of training, and certification and recertification standards, to ensure a standardized response is given when the public seeks assistance during an emergency and that standardized communications are in place to support public safety responders within Washington state.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(b) The quality of emergency response in most cases begins with the competence of public safety telecommunicators.
