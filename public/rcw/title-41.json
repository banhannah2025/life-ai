The legislature finds further that resolving employee child care concerns not only benefits the employees and their children, but may benefit the employer by reducing absenteeism, increasing employee productivity, improving morale, and enhancing the employer's position in recruiting and retaining employees. Therefore, the legislature declares that it is the policy of the state of Washington to assist state employees by creating a supportive atmosphere in which they may meet their child care needs. Policies and procedures for state agencies to address employee child care needs will be the responsibility of the director of enterprise services in consultation with the secretary of the department of children, youth, and families and state employee representatives.</div>",
