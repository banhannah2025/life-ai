The auditor may require periodic reports of agency action until all resolution has occurred. If the auditor determines that appropriate action has not been taken, the auditor shall report the determination to the governor and to the legislature and may include this determination in the agency audit under chapter  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=43.09\">43.09</a> RCW.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(10) Once the auditor concludes that appropriate action has been taken to resolve the matter, the auditor shall so notify the whistleblower, the agency head, and the subject or subjects of the investigation.
