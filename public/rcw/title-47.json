The state route number 99 Alaskan Way viaduct is susceptible to damage, closure, or catastrophic failure from earthquakes and tsunamis. Additionally, the viaduct serves as a vital route for freight and passenger vehicles through downtown Seattle.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">Since 2001, the department has undertaken an extensive evaluation of multiple options to replace the Alaskan Way viaduct, including an initial evaluation of seventy-six conceptual alternatives and a more detailed analysis of five alternatives in 2004. In addition to a substantial technical review, the department has also undertaken considerable public outreach, which included consultation with a stakeholder advisory committee that met sixteen times over a thirteen-month period.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">Therefore, it is the conclusion of the legislature that time is of the essence, and that Washington state cannot wait for a disaster to make it fully appreciate the urgency of the need to replace this vulnerable structure. The state shall take the necessary steps to expedite the environmental review and design processes to replace the Alaskan Way viaduct with a deep bore tunnel under First Avenue from the vicinity of the sports stadiums in Seattle to Aurora Avenue north of the Battery Street tunnel. The tunnel must include four general purpose lanes in a stacked formation.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(2) The state route number 99 Alaskan Way viaduct replacement project finance plan must include state funding not to exceed two billion four hundred million dollars and must also include no more than four hundred million dollars in toll revenue. These funds must be used solely to build a replacement tunnel, as described in subsection (1) of this section, and to remove the existing state route number 99 Alaskan Way viaduct. All costs associated with city utility relocations for state work as described in this section must be borne by the city of Seattle and provided in a manner that meets project construction schedule requirements as determined by the department. State funding is not authorized for any utility relocation costs, or for central seawall or waterfront promenade improvements.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(3) The department shall provide updated cost estimates for construction of the bored tunnel and also for the full Alaskan Way viaduct replacement project to the legislature and governor by January 1, 2010. The department must also consult with independent tunnel engineering experts to review the estimates and risk assumptions. The department shall not enter into a design-build contract for construction of the bored tunnel until the report in this section has been submitted.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(4) Any contract the department enters into related to construction of the deep bored tunnel must include incentives and penalties to encourage on-time completion of the project and to minimize the potential for cost overruns.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(5) It is important that the public and policymakers have accurate and timely access to information related to the Alaskan Way viaduct replacement project as it proceeds to, and during, construction of all aspects of the project, specifically including but not limited to information regarding costs, schedules, contracts, project status, and neighborhood impacts. Therefore it is the intent of the legislature that the state, city, and county departments of transportation establish a single source of accountability for integration, coordination, tracking, and information of all requisite components of the replacement project, which must include, at minimum:</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(a) A master schedule of all subprojects included in the full replacement project or program; and</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(b) A single point of contact for the public, media, stakeholders, and other interested parties.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(6)(a) The city and county departments of transportation shall be responsible for the cost, delivery, and associated risks of the project components for which each department is responsible, as outlined in the January 13, 2009, letter of agreement signed by the governor, city, and county.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(b) The state's contribution shall not exceed two billion four hundred million dollars.

The absence of a comprehensive and coordinated state policy that facilitates freight movements to local, national, and international markets limits trade opportunities.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(3) Freight corridors that serve international and domestic interstate and intrastate trade, and those freight corridors that enhance the state's competitive position through regional and global gateways are strategically important. In many instances, movement of freight on these corridors is diminished by: Barriers that block or delay access to intermodal facilities where freight is transferred from one mode of transport to another; conflicts between rail and road traffic; constraints on rail capacity; highway capacity constraints, congestion, and condition; waterway system depths that affect capacity; and institutional, regulatory, and operational barriers.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(4) The negative impacts of freight transportation do not fall equally on all residents of Washington, and historically the negative impacts have been concentrated or felt most acutely within overburdened communities. Overburdened communities and vulnerable populations tend to be disproportionately located next to industrial areas and freight facilities such as ports, rail yards, highways, and truck stops. As such, the incidence of many health conditions, traffic accidents involving nondrivers, and highways dividing communities are among the highest in these communities. Freight mobility improvement efforts must prevent or minimize community impacts in areas of high freight movements and must encourage the active participation of communities in the early stages of proposed public and private infrastructure investments.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(5) Greenhouse gas emissions from freight transportation contribute to global climate change. In keeping with RCW  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=70A.45.020\">70A.45.020</a>, freight mobility efforts must facilitate a transition to zero-emissions technology and proposed public and private infrastructure investments must align with this transition. Projects that invest in zero emissions vehicle refueling and transportation patterns and zero-emissions freight movement corridors should be included within the investment program.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(6) Ownership of the freight mobility network is fragmented and spread across various public jurisdictions, private companies, and state and national borders. Transportation projects have grown in complexity and size, requiring more resources and longer implementation time frames. Currently, there is no comprehensive and integrated framework for planning the freight mobility needs of public and private stakeholders in the freight transportation system. A coordinated planning process should identify new infrastructure investments that are integrated by public and private planning bodies into a multimodal and multijurisdictional network in all areas of the state, urban and rural, east and west. The state should integrate freight mobility goals with state policy on related issues such as economic development, growth management, and environmental management.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(7) State investment in projects that enhance or mitigate freight movements, should pay special attention to solutions that utilize a corridor solution to address freight mobility issues with important transportation and economic impacts beyond any local area. The corridor approach builds partnerships and fosters coordinated planning among jurisdictions and the public and private sectors.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(8) It is the policy of the state of Washington that limited public transportation funding and competition between freight and general mobility improvements for the same fund sources require strategic, prioritized freight investments that reduce barriers to freight movement, maximize cost-effectiveness, yield a return on the state's investment, require complementary investments by public and private interests, and solve regional freight mobility problems. State financial assistance for freight mobility projects must leverage other funds from all potential partners and sources, including federal, county, city, port district, and private capital.</div>",

The secretary of transportation should be vested with the authority to solicit, evaluate, negotiate, and administer public-private agreements with the private sector relating to the planning, construction, upgrading, or reconstruction of transportation systems and facilities.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">Agreements negotiated under a public-private initiatives program will not bestow on private entities an immediate right to construct and operate the proposed transportation facilities. Rather, agreements will grant to private entities the opportunity to design the proposed facilities, demonstrate public support for proposed facilities, and complete the planning processes required in order to obtain a future decision by the department of transportation and other state and local lead agencies on whether the facilities should be permitted and built.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">Agreements negotiated under the public-private initiatives program should establish the conditions under which the private developer may secure the approval necessary to develop and operate the proposed transportation facilities; create a framework to attract the private capital necessary to finance their development; ensure that the transportation facilities will be designed, constructed, and operated in accordance with applicable local, regional, state, and federal laws and the applicable standards and policies of the department of transportation; and require a demonstration that the proposed transportation facility has the support of the affected communities and local jurisdictions.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">The legislature finds that the Puget Sound congestion pricing project, selected under this chapter, raises major transportation policy, economic, and equity concerns.

The legislature further finds that these potential economic and social impacts require comprehensive legislative review prior to advancement of the project and directs that the secretary not proceed with the implementation of the project without prior approval of the legislature.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">The department of transportation should be encouraged to take advantage of new opportunities provided by federal legislation under section 1012 of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA).

          "bodyHtml": "<div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(1) The legislature finds funding of the Tacoma Narrows bridge facility to be distinct from other Washington state tolling facilities due to its increasing debt service costs, which is the primary driver of the facility's escalating costs. Washington state has since recommended and established financing structures with steadier levels of debt service payments for subsequent tolled transportation facilities, supporting better management of the state's debt burden and a lower financial burden for toll ratepayers.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(2) The Tacoma Narrows bridge facility debt service structure resulted, in part, from a decision by the legislature to fund construction of the bridge without drawing from state tax dollars. As a result, toll revenue was committed to fund 99 percent of bridge construction costs, as well as the associated interest payments and other associated debt service costs. This is not the standard more recently utilized by the legislature, as is the case of the state route 520 bridge's construction, 72 percent of which is to be paid for with toll revenues. In light of the maximum burden for bridge construction that was placed on Tacoma Narrows bridge toll ratepayers, there is no equitable reason that the burden of future debt service payment increases should be borne by these same toll ratepayers.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(3) The legislature established the Tacoma Narrows bridge work group in 2017 and tasked it with identifying opportunities for long-term toll payer relief from increasing toll rates on the Tacoma Narrows bridge.&nbsp;The work group recommended a request of up to $125,000,000 in state funding from the legislature to offset future debt service payment increases, allocated across the remaining years of tolling at levels that result in maintaining toll rates at fiscal year 2018 levels.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(4) Due to the findings aforementioned, an alternative is put forward by the legislature. State contribution loans for each fiscal biennium are to be made through the life of the debt service plan of up to a total of $85,000,000, and will be repaid in annual amounts beginning after the debt service and deferred sales tax are fully repaid. It is the intent of the legislature that the commission will adjust tolls accordingly, in consideration of annual contributions from nontoll sources and the costs required to be covered under RCW  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=47.46.100\">47.46.100</a>, until such time as the debt service and deferred sales tax obligation is fully met according to the repayment schedule in place as of June 7, 2018, and until any state contribution loans are fully repaid.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(5) To offset part of the toll rate increases that would otherwise be necessary to meet increases in future debt service payments, it is the intent of the legislature that the state treasurer make state contribution loan transfers to the Tacoma Narrows toll bridge account created in RCW  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=47.56.165\">47.56.165</a> on the first day of each fiscal biennium, beginning in the 2019-2021 fiscal biennium, through the life of the debt service plan.

Tolling should be used when it can be demonstrated to contribute a significant portion of the cost of a project that cannot be funded solely with existing sources or optimize the performance of the transportation system. Such tolling should, in all cases, be fairly and equitably applied in the context of the statewide transportation system and not have significant adverse impacts through the diversion of traffic to other routes that cannot otherwise be reasonably mitigated. Such tolling should also consider relevant social equity, environmental, and economic issues, and should be directed at making progress toward the state's greenhouse gas reduction goals.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(3) Use of toll revenue. All revenue from an eligible toll facility must be used only to improve, preserve, manage, or operate the eligible toll facility on or in which the revenue is collected. Additionally, toll revenue should provide for and encourage the inclusion of recycled and reclaimed construction materials.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(4) Setting toll rates. Toll rates, which may include variable pricing, must be set to meet anticipated funding obligations. To the extent possible, the toll rates should be set to optimize system performance, recognizing necessary trade-offs to generate revenue.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(5) Duration of toll collection.

The state's freight rail system, including branch lines, mainlines, rail corridors, terminals, yards, and equipment, is an important element of this multimodal system. Washington's economy relies heavily upon the freight rail system to ensure movement of the state's agricultural, chemical, and natural resources and manufactured products to local, national, and international markets and thereby contributes to the economic vitality of the state.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">Since 1970, Washington has lost over one-third of its rail miles to abandonment and bankruptcies. The combination of rail abandonments and rail system capacity constraints may alter the delivery to market of many commodities. In addition, the resultant motor vehicle freight traffic increases the burden on state highways and county roads. In many cases, the cost of maintaining and upgrading the state highways and county roads exceeds the cost of maintaining rail freight service. Thus, the economy of the state will be best served by a policy of maintaining and encouraging a healthy rail freight system by creating mechanisms that keep rail freight lines operating if the benefits of the service outweigh the cost.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">Recognizing the implications of this trend for freight mobility and the state's economic future, the legislature finds that better freight rail planning, better cooperation to preserve rail lines, and increased financial assistance from the state are necessary to maintain and improve the freight rail system within the state.</div>",
