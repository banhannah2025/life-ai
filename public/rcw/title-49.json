The legislature further finds that many employers establish different leave policies for men and women regarding the care of a newborn or newly placed child. The legislature recognizes that the bonding that occurs between a parent and child is important to the nurturing of that child, regardless of whether the parent is the child's biological parent and regardless of the gender of the parent. For these reasons, the legislature declares that it is the public policy of this state to require that employers who grant leave to their employees to care for a newborn child make the same leave available upon the same terms for adoptive parents and stepparents, men and women.</div>",

A notice of appeal filed under this section stays the effectiveness of a citation or notice of the assessment of a penalty pending review of the appeal by the director, but such appeal does not stay the effectiveness of an order of immediate restraint issued under this section. Upon receipt of an appeal, a hearing must be held in accordance with chapter  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=34.05\">34.05</a> RCW.

When the department is foreclosing on a wage lien, the date the wage lien was originally filed shall be the date by which priority is determined, regardless of the date the warrant is filed under this section. If a claimant has timely notified the department that the claimant will pursue foreclosure on their own, without the department's assistance, the department is not required to file a warrant under this section and is relieved from any liability related to foreclosing on the claimant's wage lien.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(4) Whenever any employer quits business, sells out, exchanges, or otherwise disposes of the employer's business or stock of goods, any person who becomes a successor to the business becomes liable for the full amount of any outstanding citation and notice of assessment or penalty against the employer's business under this chapter if, at the time of the conveyance of the business, the successor has: (a) Actual knowledge of the fact and amount of the outstanding citation and notice of assessment or (b) a prompt, reasonable, and effective means of accessing and verifying the fact and amount of the outstanding citation and notice of assessment from the department. If the citation and notice of assessment or penalty is not paid in full by the employer within ten days of the date of the sale, exchange, or disposal, the successor is liable for the payment of the full amount of the citation and notice of assessment or penalty, and payment thereof by the successor must, to the extent thereof, be deemed a payment upon the purchase price. If the payment is greater in amount than the purchase price, the amount of the difference becomes a debt due the successor from the employer.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(5) This section does not affect other collection remedies that are otherwise provided by law.</div>",

Any person may provide written notice to an employer alleging that the employer's posting does not comply with this subsection (1). If an employer receives notice from any person as to a particular posting, this constitutes adequate notice for the duration of that posting for any job applicant seeking remedies under subsection (4) or (5) of this section. If the employer corrects the posting within five business days of receiving the written notice and, where applicable, contacts any applicable third-party posting entity with a demand to correct the posting, then neither the department nor the court may assess or award penalties, damages, or other relief under this section for the violation.

If ordering statutory damages, the department shall consider the following when determining the amount of those damages: Whether the violation was committed willfully or the violation is a repeat violation; the size of the employer; the amount necessary to deter future noncompliance; the purposes of this chapter; and any other factor deemed appropriate by the department.

          "bodyHtml": "<div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(1) The legislature finds that, as the citizens of Washington state age and their life expectancy increases, demand for long-term care is also on the rise. Like many Americans, Washingtonians prefer to stay in their own homes and communities as they age, fueling an increased demand for home-based long-term services and supports. Nationally, the direct care workforce is expected to increase by more than one million jobs, making this one of the fastest growing occupations in the country.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(2) As the state of Washington is a national leader in supporting individuals to receive services in their own homes where self-direction, autonomy, choice, and dignity is valued. The average needs and acuity levels of people served in their homes has increased and become more diverse. The prevalence of individuals with complex behaviors due to their disabilities is a growing issue experienced by individuals who need assistance with personal care tasks in their own homes and to be able to fully integrate in community living.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(3) The lack of workplace safety, including incidents of verbal and physical aggression, as well as sexual harassment, is an occupational hazard for many long-term care workers, including those who work in the homes of the person to whom they provide care. The risk may be outside the control of the individual receiving care due to the conduct of others in the home. The risk may be due to symptoms or conditions that can manifest with individuals communicating their needs in ways that an individual caring for the person may experience or interpret as harassment, abuse, or violence. In any event, caregivers should not have to experience discrimination, abusive conduct, and challenging behaviors without assistance or redress.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(4) Workers who have adverse experiences at work can manifest negative physical and mental health outcomes. These workers often leave the field of direct caregiving, resulting in fewer available caregivers in the workforce, increased turnover, and lower quality of care received by individuals in their own homes.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(5) Adequate preparation of caregivers helps both the caregiver and person receiving care. Caregivers should be equipped with information, including relevant care plans and behavioral support interventions, existing problem-solving tools, and strategies to improve safe care delivery.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(6) The legislature further finds that caregivers are the backbone of long-term services and supports in Washington. Therefore, the intent of chapter 309, Laws of 2020 is to reduce the instances of harassment, discrimination, and abuse experienced by caregivers, and ensure that they feel safe while providing care while also prioritizing the continuity of care for individuals who rely on their assistance. This will improve the quality of care provided to Washingtonians and build a strong workforce to meet future care needs in the state.</div>",
