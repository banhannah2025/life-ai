          "bodyHtml": "<div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">Whereas, economic insecurity due to unemployment is a serious menace to the health, morals, and welfare of the people of this state; involuntary unemployment is, therefore, a subject of general interest and concern which requires appropriate action by the legislature to prevent its spread and to lighten its burden which now so often falls with crushing force upon the unemployed worker and his or her family. Social security requires protection against this greatest hazard of our economic life. This can be provided only by application of the insurance principle of sharing the risks, and by the systematic accumulation of funds during periods of employment to provide benefits for periods of unemployment, thus maintaining purchasing powers and limiting the serious social consequences of relief assistance. The state of Washington, therefore, exercising herein its police and sovereign power endeavors by this title to remedy any widespread unemployment situation which may occur and to set up safeguards to prevent its recurrence in the years to come. The legislature, therefore, declares that in its considered judgment the public good, and the general welfare of the citizens of this state require the enactment of this measure, under the police powers of the state, for the compulsory setting aside of unemployment reserves to be used for the benefit of persons unemployed through no fault of their own, and that this title shall be liberally construed for the purpose of reducing involuntary unemployment and the suffering caused thereby to the minimum.</div>",

Some of these gaps in services can be filled by citizen volunteers through an organized program to recruit and place volunteers and to expand opportunities for volunteers to serve their communities;</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(2) The federal government is proposing expansion of national services programs. These programs may require significant matching resources from states. State funds supporting the Washington serves program can serve as a required matching source to leverage additional federal national service resources;</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(3) Washington state has, through the Washington service corps, successfully offered service opportunities and meaningful work experience to young adults between the ages of eighteen and twenty-five years;</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(4) The need exists to expand full-time volunteer opportunities to citizens age twenty-one and over, to encourage senior citizens, college graduates, professional and technically skilled persons, and other adult citizens, to contribute their critical expertise, experience, labor, and commitment to meeting the needs of their communities;</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(5) It is appropriate and in the public's interest for Washington state to create opportunities for citizens to engage in full-time, meaningful volunteer service in governmental or private nonprofit agencies, institutions, programs, or activities that address the social, economic, educational, civic, cultural, or environmental needs of local communities;</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(6) Through volunteer service, citizens apply their skills and knowledge to the resolution of critical problems or meeting unmet needs, gain valuable experience, refine or develop new skills, and instill a sense of civic pride and commitment to their community;</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(7) There is a need to coordinate state and federally funded volunteer service programs that provide living allowances and other benefits to volunteers to maximize the benefits to volunteers and the organizations in which they serve.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">It is therefore the legislature's desire to expand full-time volunteer opportunities for citizens age twenty-one and over and to provide appropriate incentives to those who serve. Such a program should be implemented statewide and coordinated across programs.</div>",
