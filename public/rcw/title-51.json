          "bodyHtml": "<div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">The common law system governing the remedy of workers against employers for injuries received in employment is inconsistent with modern industrial conditions. In practice it proves to be economically unwise and unfair. Its administration has produced the result that little of the cost of the employer has reached the worker and that little only at large expense to the public. The remedy of the worker has been uncertain, slow and inadequate. Injuries in such works, formerly occasional, have become frequent and inevitable. The welfare of the state depends upon its industries, and even more upon the welfare of its wage worker. The state of Washington, therefore, exercising herein its police and sovereign power, declares that all phases of the premises are withdrawn from private controversy, and sure and certain relief for workers, injured in their work, and their families and dependents is hereby provided regardless of questions of fault and to the exclusion of every other remedy, proceeding or compensation, except as otherwise provided in this title; and to that end all civil actions and civil causes of action for such personal injuries and all jurisdiction of the courts of the state over such causes are hereby abolished, except as in this title provided.</div>",

The appointments must be made from lists of nominations provided by statewide business, self-insured employers, and labor organizations.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(2) Prior to or during plan development, the department may authorize payment for workers who choose to pursue basic skills development training, such as English as a second language and general equivalency degree courses.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(3)(a) For the purposes of this section, the day the worker commences vocational plan development means the date the department or self-insurer notifies the worker of his or her eligibility for plan development services or of an eligibility determination in response to a dispute of a vocational decision.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(b) When the supervisor or supervisor's designee has decided that vocational rehabilitation is both necessary and likely to make the worker employable at gainful employment, he or she must be provided with services necessary to develop a vocational plan that, if completed, would render the worker employable. The vocational professional assigned to the claim must, at the initial meeting with the worker, fully inform the worker of the return-to-work priorities set forth in RCW  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=51.32.095\">51.32.095</a>(3) and of his or her rights and responsibilities under the workers' compensation vocational system.

However, at the sole discretion of the supervisor or the supervisor's designee, an employer may be granted an extension of time of up to 10 additional days to make a valid return-to-work offer. The additional days may be allowed by the department with or without a request from the employer. The extension may only be granted if the employer made a return-to-work offer to the worker within 15 days of the date the worker commenced vocational plan development that met some but not all of the requirements in this section. To be valid, the offer must be for bona fide employment with the employer of injury, consistent with the worker's documented physical and mental restrictions as provided by the worker's health care provider. When the employer makes a valid return-to-work offer, the vocational plan development services and temporary total disability compensation must be terminated effective on the starting date for the job without regard to whether the worker accepts the return-to-work offer.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(d) Following the time period described in (c) of this subsection, the employer may still provide, and the worker may accept, any valid return-to-work offer. The worker's acceptance of such an offer must result in the termination of vocational plan development or implementation services and temporary total disability compensation effective the day the employment begins.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(4)(a) All vocational plans must contain an accountability agreement signed by the worker detailing expectations regarding progress, attendance, and other factors influencing successful participation in the plan.

This amount must be adjusted effective July 1st of each year for vocational plans or retraining benefits available under subsection (5)(b) of this section approved on or after this date but before June 30th of the next year based on the average percentage change in tuition for the next fall quarter for all Washington state community colleges.&nbsp;Effective July 1, 2016, and each July 1st thereafter, the increase cannot exceed two percent per year, unless the amount available would be less than 150 percent of the average cost of a two-year community college training plan. Effective July 1st following the calendar year in which the amount available is less than 150 percent of the average cost of a two-year community college plan, costs for newly approved plans can be up to 150 percent of this community college plan average. The average cost of two-year community college training plans will be calculated by the department based on plans completed during the preceding calendar year.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(e) The duration of the vocational plan may not exceed two years from the date the plan is implemented.

A vocational rehabilitation plan must be developed by the worker and the vocational professional and submitted to the department or self-insurer. Following this submission, the worker must elect one of the following options:</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(a) Option 1: The department or self-insurer implements and the worker participates in the vocational plan developed by the vocational professional and approved by the worker and the department or self-insurer. For state fund claims, the department must review and approve the vocational plan before implementation may begin. If the department takes no action within 15 days, the plan is deemed approved. Beginning the date the department approves the plan, or the date of a determination that the plan is valid following a dispute, through completion of the first academic quarter or three months' training, the worker may elect option 2. However, in the sole discretion of the supervisor or supervisor's designee, the department may approve an election for option 2 benefits that was submitted in writing within 25 days of the end of the first academic quarter or three months' training if the worker provides a written explanation establishing that he or she was unable to submit his or her election of option 2 benefits within 15 days. In no circumstance may the department approve of an election for option 2 benefits that was submitted more than 25 days after the end of the first academic quarter or three months' training.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(i) Following successful completion of the vocational plan, any subsequent assessment of whether vocational rehabilitation is both necessary and likely to enable the injured worker to become employable at gainful employment under RCW  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=51.32.095\">51.32.095</a>(1) must include consideration of transferable skills obtained in the vocational plan.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(ii) If a vocational plan is successfully completed on a claim which is thereafter reopened as provided in RCW  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=51.32.160\">51.32.160</a>, the cost and duration available for any subsequent vocational plan is limited to that in subsection (4)(d) and (e) of this section, less that previously expended.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(b) Option 2: The worker declines further vocational services under the claim and receives an amount equal to nine months of temporary total disability compensation under RCW  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=51.32.090\">51.32.090</a>. The award must be reduced by the amount of any temporary total disability compensation paid for days starting with the first day of the academic quarter or three months' training and for any days through the date the department received the worker's written election of option 2.&nbsp;The award is payable in biweekly payments in accordance with the schedule of temporary total disability payments, until such award is paid in full. These payments may not include interest on the unpaid balance. However, upon application by the worker, and at the discretion of the department, the compensation may be converted to a lump sum payment. The vocational costs defined in subsection (4)(d) of this section must remain available to the worker less any amount expended for the worker's participation in the first academic quarter or three months' training, upon application to the department or self-insurer, for a period of five years. The vocational costs must, if expended, be available for programs or courses at any accredited or licensed institution or program from a list of those approved by the department for tuition, books, fees, supplies, equipment, and tools, without department or self-insurer oversight. Up to 10 percent of the total funds available to the worker can be used for vocational counseling and job placement services.&nbsp;The department must issue an order as provided in RCW  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=51.52.050\">51.52.050</a> confirming the option 2 election, setting a payment schedule, and terminating temporary total disability benefits effective the date of the order confirming that election. The department must thereafter close the claim. A worker who elects option 2 benefits is not entitled to further temporary total, or to permanent total, disability benefits except upon a showing of a worsening in the condition or conditions accepted under the claim such that claim closure is not appropriate, in which case the option 2 selection must be rescinded and the amount paid to the worker must be assessed as an overpayment. A claim that was closed based on the worker's election of option 2 benefits may be reopened as provided in RCW  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=51.32.160\">51.32.160</a>, but cannot be reopened for the sole purpose of allowing the worker to seek vocational assistance.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(i) If, within five years from the date the option 2 order becomes final, the worker is subsequently injured or suffers an occupational disease or reopens the claim as provided in RCW  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=51.32.160\">51.32.160</a>, and vocational rehabilitation is found both necessary and likely to enable the injured worker to become employable at gainful employment under RCW  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=51.32.095\">51.32.095</a>(1), the duration of any vocational plan under subsection (4)(e) of this section may not exceed 15 months.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(ii) If the available vocational costs are utilized by the worker, any subsequent assessment of whether vocational rehabilitation is both necessary and likely to enable the injured worker to become employable at gainful employment under RCW  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=51.32.095\">51.32.095</a>(1) must include consideration of the transferable skills obtained.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(iii) If the available vocational costs are utilized by the worker and the claim is thereafter reopened as provided in RCW  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=51.32.160\">51.32.160</a>, the cost available for any vocational plan is limited to that in subsection (4)(d) of this section less that previously expended.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(iv) Option 2 may only be elected once per worker.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(c) The director, in his or her sole discretion, may provide the worker vocational assistance not to exceed that in subsection (4) of this section, without regard to the worker's prior option selection or benefits expended, where vocational assistance would prevent permanent total disability under RCW  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=51.32.060\">51.32.060</a>.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(6)(a) \"Vocational plan interruption\" for the purposes of this section means an occurrence which disrupts the plan to the extent the employability goal is no longer attainable. \"Vocational plan interruption\" does not include institutionally scheduled breaks in educational programs, occasional absence due to illness, or modifications to the plan which will allow it to be completed within the cost and time provisions of subsection (4)(d) and (e) of this section.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(b) When a vocational plan interruption is beyond the control of the worker, the department or self-insurer must recommence plan development. If necessary to complete vocational services, the cost and duration of the plan may include credit for that expended prior to the interruption. A vocational plan interruption is considered outside the control of the worker when it is due to the closure of the accredited institution, when it is due to a death in the worker's immediate family, or when documented changes in the worker's accepted medical conditions prevent further participation in the vocational plan.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(c) When a vocational plan interruption is the result of the worker's actions, the worker's entitlement to benefits must be suspended in accordance with RCW  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=51.32.110\">51.32.110</a>, including the opportunity for the worker to demonstrate good cause. If plan development or implementation is recommenced, the cost and duration of the plan may not include credit for that expended prior to the interruption. A vocational plan interruption is considered a result of the worker's actions when it is due to the failure to meet attendance expectations set by the training or educational institution, failure to achieve passing grades or acceptable performance review, unaccepted or postinjury conditions that prevent further participation in the vocational plan, or the worker's failure to abide by the accountability agreement in subsection (4)(a) of this section.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(7) Costs paid for vocational services and plans must be chargeable to the employer's cost experience or must be paid by the self-insurer, as the case may be. For state fund vocational plans implemented on or after January 1, 2008, the costs may be paid from the medical aid fund at the sole discretion of the director under the following circumstances:</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(a) The worker previously participated in a vocational plan or selected a worker option as described in subsection (5) of this section;</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(b) The worker's prior vocational plan or selected option was based on an approved plan or option on or after January 1, 2008;</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(c) For state fund employers, the date of injury or disease manifestation of the subsequent claim is within the period of time used to calculate their experience factor;</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(d) The subsequent claim is for an injury or occupational disease that resulted from employment and work-related activities beyond the worker's documented restrictions.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(8) The vocational plan costs payable from the medical aid fund must include the costs of temporary total disability benefits, except those payable from the supplemental pension fund, from the date the vocational plan is implemented to the date the worker completes the plan or ceases participation. The vocational costs paid from the medical aid fund may not be charged to the state fund employer's cost experience.</div>",

However, the department or self-insurer may limit reimbursement to the department's standard fee for the services. The provider must comply with all applicable billing policies and must accept the department's fee schedule as payment in full.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(c) The department, in collaboration with the advisory group, shall adopt policies for the development, credentialing, accreditation, and continued oversight of a network of health care providers approved to treat injured workers. Health care providers shall apply to the network by completing the department's provider application which shall have the force of a contract with the department to treat injured workers. The advisory group shall recommend minimum network standards for the department to approve a provider's application, to remove a provider from the network, or to require peer review such as, but not limited to:</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(i) Current malpractice insurance coverage exceeding a dollar amount threshold, number, or seriousness of malpractice suits over a specific time frame;</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(ii) Previous malpractice judgments or settlements that do not exceed a dollar amount threshold recommended by the advisory group, or a specific number or seriousness of malpractice suits over a specific time frame;</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(iii) No licensing or disciplinary action in any jurisdiction or loss of treating or admitting privileges by any board, commission, agency, public or private health care payer, or hospital;</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(iv) For some specialties such as surgeons, privileges in at least one hospital;</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(v) Whether the provider has been credentialed by another health plan that follows national quality assurance guidelines; and</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(vi) Alternative criteria for providers that are not credentialed by another health plan.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">The department shall develop alternative criteria for providers that are not credentialed by another health plan or as needed to address access to care concerns in certain regions.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(d) Network provider contracts will automatically renew at the end of the contract period unless the department provides written notice of changes in contract provisions or the department or provider provides written notice of contract termination. The industrial insurance medical advisory committee shall develop criteria for removal of a provider from the network to be presented to the department and advisory group for consideration in the development of contract terms.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(e) In order to monitor quality of care and assure efficient management of the provider network, the department shall establish additional criteria and terms for network participation including, but not limited to, requiring compliance with administrative and billing policies.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(f) The advisory group shall recommend best practices standards to the department to use in determining second tier network providers. The department shall develop and implement financial and nonfinancial incentives for network providers who qualify for the second tier. The department is authorized to certify and decertify second tier providers.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(3) The department shall work with self-insurers and the department utilization review provider to implement utilization review for the self-insured community to ensure consistent quality, cost-effective care for all injured workers and employers, and to reduce administrative burden for providers.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(4) The department for state fund claims shall pay, in accordance with the department's fee schedule, for any alleged injury for which a worker files a claim, any initial prescription drugs provided in relation to that initial visit, without regard to whether the worker's claim for benefits is allowed. In all accepted claims, treatment shall be limited in point of duration as follows:</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">In the case of permanent partial disability, not to extend beyond the date when compensation shall be awarded him or her, except when the worker returned to work before permanent partial disability award is made, in such case not to extend beyond the time when monthly allowances to him or her shall cease; in case of temporary disability not to extend beyond the time when monthly allowances to him or her shall cease: PROVIDED, That after any injured worker has returned to his or her work his or her medical and surgical treatment may be continued if, and so long as, such continuation is deemed necessary by the supervisor of industrial insurance to be necessary to his or her more complete recovery; in case of a permanent total disability not to extend beyond the date on which a lump sum settlement is made with him or her or he or she is placed upon the permanent pension roll: PROVIDED, HOWEVER, That the supervisor of industrial insurance, solely in his or her discretion, may authorize continued medical and surgical treatment for conditions previously accepted by the department when such medical and surgical treatment is deemed necessary by the supervisor of industrial insurance to protect such worker's life or provide for the administration of medical and therapeutic measures including payment of prescription medications, but not including those controlled substances currently scheduled by the pharmacy quality assurance commission as Schedule I, II, III, or IV substances under chapter  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=69.50\">69.50</a> RCW, which are necessary to alleviate continuing pain which results from the industrial injury. In order to authorize such continued treatment the written order of the supervisor of industrial insurance issued in advance of the continuation shall be necessary.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">The supervisor of industrial insurance, the supervisor's designee, or a self-insurer, in his or her sole discretion, may authorize inoculation or other immunological treatment in cases in which a work-related activity has resulted in probable exposure of the worker to a potential infectious occupational disease. Authorization of such treatment does not bind the department or self-insurer in any adjudication of a claim by the same worker or the worker's beneficiary for an occupational disease.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(5)(a) The legislature finds that the department and its business and labor partners have collaborated in establishing centers for occupational health and education to promote best practices and prevent preventable disability by focusing additional provider-based resources during the first twelve weeks following an injury. The centers for occupational health and education represent innovative accountable care systems in an early stage of development consistent with national health care reform efforts. Many Washington workers do not yet have access to these innovative health care delivery models.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(b) To expand evidence-based occupational health best practices, the department shall establish additional centers for occupational health and education, with the goal of extending access to at least fifty percent of injured and ill workers by December 2013 and to all injured workers by December 2015. The department shall also develop additional best practices and incentives that span the entire period of recovery, not only the first twelve weeks.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(c) The department shall certify and decertify centers for occupational health and education based on criteria including institutional leadership and geographic areas covered by the center for occupational health and education, occupational health leadership and education, mix of participating health care providers necessary to address the anticipated needs of injured workers, health services coordination to deliver occupational health best practices, indicators to measure the success of the center for occupational health and education, and agreement that the center's providers shall, if feasible, treat certain injured workers if referred by the department or a self-insurer.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(d) Health care delivery organizations may apply to the department for certification as a center for occupational health and education. These may include, but are not limited to, hospitals and affiliated clinics and providers, multispecialty clinics, health maintenance organizations, and organized systems of network physicians.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(e) The centers for occupational health and education shall implement benchmark quality indicators of occupational health best practices for individual providers, developed in collaboration with the department. A center for occupational health and education shall remove individual providers who do not consistently meet these quality benchmarks.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(f) The department shall develop and implement financial and nonfinancial incentives for center for occupational health and education providers that are based on progressive and measurable gains in occupational health best practices, and that are applicable throughout the duration of an injured or ill worker's episode of care.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(g) The department shall develop electronic methods of tracking evidence-based quality measures to identify and improve outcomes for injured workers at risk of developing prolonged disability. In addition, these methods must be used to provide systematic feedback to physicians regarding quality of care, to conduct appropriate objective evaluation of progress in the centers for occupational health and education, and to allow efficient coordination of services.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(6) If a provider fails to meet the minimum network standards established in subsection (2) of this section, the department is authorized to remove the provider from the network or take other appropriate action regarding a provider's participation. The department may also require remedial steps as a condition for a provider to participate in the network. The department, with input from the advisory group, shall establish waiting periods that may be imposed before a provider who has been denied or removed from the network may reapply.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(7) The department may permanently remove a provider from the network or take other appropriate action when the provider exhibits a pattern of conduct of low quality care that exposes patients to risk of physical or psychiatric harm or death. Patterns that qualify as risk of harm include, but are not limited to, poor health care outcomes evidenced by increased, chronic, or prolonged pain or decreased function due to treatments that have not been shown to be curative, safe, or effective or for which it has been shown that the risks of harm exceed the benefits that can be reasonably expected based on peer-reviewed opinion.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(8) The department may not remove a health care provider from the network for an isolated instance of poor health and recovery outcomes due to treatment by the provider.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(9) When the department terminates a provider from the network, the department or self-insurer shall assist an injured worker currently under the provider's care in identifying a new network provider or providers from whom the worker can select an attending or treating provider. In such a case, the department or self-insurer shall notify the injured worker that he or she must choose a new attending or treating provider.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(10) The department may adopt rules related to this section.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(11) The department shall report to the workers' compensation advisory committee and to the appropriate committees of the legislature on each December 1st, beginning in 2012 and ending in 2016, on the implementation of the provider network and expansion of the centers for occupational health and education. The reports must include a summary of actions taken, progress toward long-term goals, outcomes of key initiatives, access to care issues, results of disputes or controversies related to new provisions, and whether any changes are needed to further improve the occupational health best practices care of injured workers.</div>",
