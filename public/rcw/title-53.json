These procedures may be used if an owner mooring or storing a vessel at the moorage facility fails, after being notified that charges are owing and of the owner's right to commence legal proceedings to contest that such charges are owing, to pay the port charges owed or to commence legal proceedings. Notification shall be by registered mail to the owner at his or her last known address. In the case of a transient vessel, or where no address was furnished by the owner, the moorage facility operator need not give such notice prior to securing the vessel.

Costs of any such procedure shall be paid by the vessel's owner.

Either a minimum bid may be established or a letter of credit may be required, or both, to discourage the future reabandonment of the vessel.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(a) Before the vessel is sold, the owner of the vessel shall be given at least twenty days' notice of the sale in the manner set forth in subsection (1) of this section if the name and address of the owner is known.
