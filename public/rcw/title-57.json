The right of eminent domain shall be exercised in the same manner and by the same procedure as provided for cities and towns, insofar as consistent with this title, except that all assessment or reassessment rolls to be prepared and filed by eminent domain commissioners or commissioners appointed by the court shall be prepared and filed by the district, and the duties devolving upon the city treasurer are imposed upon the county treasurer;</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(2) To lease real or personal property necessary for its purposes for a term of years for which that leased property may reasonably be needed;</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(3) To construct, condemn and purchase, add to, maintain, and supply waterworks to furnish the district and inhabitants thereof and any other persons, both within and without the district, with an ample supply of water for all uses and purposes public and private with full authority to regulate and control the use, content, distribution, and price thereof in such a manner as is not in conflict with general law and may construct, acquire, or own buildings and other necessary district facilities. Where a customer connected to the district's system uses the water on an intermittent or transient basis, a district may charge for providing water service to such a customer, regardless of the amount of water, if any, used by the customer.

For the purposes of waterworks which include facilities for the generation of electricity as a by-product, nothing in this section may be construed to authorize a district to condemn electric generating, transmission, or distribution rights or facilities of entities authorized by law to distribute electricity, or to acquire such rights or facilities without the consent of the owner;</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(4) To purchase and take water from any municipal corporation, private person, or entity. A district contiguous to Canada may contract with a Canadian corporation for the purchase of water and for the construction, purchase, maintenance, and supply of waterworks to furnish the district and inhabitants thereof and residents of Canada with an ample supply of water under the terms approved by the board of commissioners;</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(5) To construct, condemn and purchase, add to, maintain, and operate systems of sewers for the purpose of furnishing the district, the inhabitants thereof, and persons outside the district with an adequate system of sewers for all uses and purposes, public and private, including but not limited to on-site sewage disposal facilities, approved septic tanks or approved septic tank systems, on-site sanitary sewerage systems, inspection services and maintenance services for private and public on-site systems, point and nonpoint water pollution monitoring programs that are directly related to the sewerage facilities and programs operated by a district, other facilities, programs, and systems for the collection, interception, treatment, and disposal of wastewater, and for the control of pollution from wastewater with full authority to regulate the use and operation thereof and the service rates to be charged. Under this chapter, after July 1, 1998, any requirements for pumping the septic tank of an on-site sewage system should be based, among other things, on actual measurement of accumulation of sludge and scum by a trained inspector, trained owner's agent, or trained owner. Training must occur in a program approved by the state board of health or by a local health officer. Sewage facilities may include facilities which result in combined sewage disposal or treatment and electric or methane gas generation, except that the electricity or methane gas generated thereby is a by-product of the system of sewers. Such electricity or methane gas may be used by the district or sold to any entity authorized by law to distribute electricity or methane gas. Electricity and methane gas are deemed by-products when the electrical or methane gas generation is subordinate to the primary purpose of sewage disposal or treatment. The district may also sell surplus methane gas, which may be produced as a by-product. For such purposes a district may conduct sewage throughout the district and throughout other political subdivisions within the district, and construct and lay sewer pipe along and upon public highways, roads, and streets, within and without the district, and condemn and purchase or acquire land and rights-of-way necessary for such sewer pipe. A district may erect sewage treatment plants within or without the district, and may acquire, by purchase or condemnation, properties or privileges necessary to be had to protect any lakes, rivers, or watercourses and also other areas of land from pollution from its sewers or its sewage treatment plant. For the purposes of sewage facilities which include facilities that result in combined sewage disposal or treatment and electric generation where the electric generation is a by-product, nothing in this section may be construed to authorize a district to condemn electric generating, transmission, or distribution rights or facilities of entities authorized by law to distribute electricity, or to acquire such rights or facilities without the consent of the owners;</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(6) The authority to construct, condemn and purchase, add to, maintain, and operate systems of reclaimed water as authorized by chapter  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=90.46\">90.46</a> RCW for the purpose of furnishing the district and the inhabitants thereof with reclaimed water for all authorized uses and purposes, public and private, including with full authority to regulate the use and operation thereof and the service rates to be charged. In compliance with other sections of this chapter, a district may also provide reclaimed water services to persons outside the district;</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(7)(a) To construct, condemn and purchase, add to, maintain, and operate systems of drainage for the benefit and use of the district, the inhabitants thereof, and persons outside the district with an adequate system of drainage, including but not limited to facilities and systems for the collection, interception, treatment, and disposal of storm or surface waters, and for the protection, preservation, and rehabilitation of surface and underground waters, and drainage facilities for public highways, streets, and roads, with full authority to regulate the use and operation thereof and, except as provided in (b) of this subsection, the service rates to be charged.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(b) The rate a district may charge under this section for storm or surface water sewer systems or the portion of the rate allocable to the storm or surface water sewer system of combined sanitary sewage and storm or surface water sewer systems shall be reduced by a minimum of ten percent for any new or remodeled commercial building that utilizes a permissive rainwater harvesting system. Rainwater harvesting systems shall be properly sized to utilize the available roof surface of the building. The jurisdiction shall consider rate reductions in excess of ten percent dependent upon the amount of rainwater harvested.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(c) Drainage facilities may include natural systems. Drainage facilities may include facilities which result in combined drainage facilities and electric generation, except that the electricity generated thereby is a by-product of the drainage system. Such electricity may be used by the district or sold to any entity authorized by law to distribute electricity. Electricity is deemed a by-product when the electrical generation is subordinate to the primary purpose of drainage collection, disposal, and treatment. For such purposes, a district may conduct storm or surface water throughout the district and throughout other political subdivisions within the district, construct and lay drainage pipe and culverts along and upon public highways, roads, and streets, within and without the district, and condemn and purchase or acquire land and rights-of-way necessary for such drainage systems. A district may provide or erect facilities and improvements for the treatment and disposal of storm or surface water within or without the district, and may acquire, by purchase or condemnation, properties or privileges necessary to be had to protect any lakes, rivers, or watercourses and also other areas of land from pollution from storm or surface waters. For the purposes of drainage facilities which include facilities that also generate electricity as a by-product, nothing in this section may be construed to authorize a district to condemn electric generating, transmission, or distribution rights or facilities of entities authorized by law to distribute electricity, or to acquire such rights or facilities without the consent of the owners;</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(8) To construct, condemn, acquire, and own buildings and other necessary district facilities;</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(9) To compel all property owners within the district located within an area served by the district's system of sewers to connect their private drain and sewer systems with the district's system under such penalty as the commissioners shall prescribe by resolution. The district may for such purpose enter upon private property and connect the private drains or sewers with the district system and the cost thereof shall be charged against the property owner and shall be a lien upon property served;</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(10) Where a district contains within its borders, abuts, or is located adjacent to any lake, stream, groundwater as defined by RCW  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=90.44.035\">90.44.035</a>, or other waterway within the state of Washington, to provide for the reduction, minimization, or elimination of pollutants from those waters in accordance with the district's comprehensive plan, and to issue general obligation bonds, revenue bonds, local improvement district bonds, or utility local improvement bonds for the purpose of paying all or any part of the cost of reducing, minimizing, or eliminating the pollutants from these waters;</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(11) Subject to subsection (7) of this section, to fix rates and charges for water, sewer, reclaimed water, and drain service supplied and to charge property owners seeking to connect to the district's systems, as a condition to granting the right to so connect, in addition to the cost of the connection, such reasonable connection charge as the board of commissioners shall determine to be proper in order that those property owners shall bear their equitable share of the cost of the system. For the purposes of calculating a connection charge, the board of commissioners shall determine the pro rata share of the cost of existing facilities and facilities planned for construction within the next ten years and contained in an adopted comprehensive plan and other costs borne by the district which are directly attributable to the improvements required by property owners seeking to connect to the system. The cost of existing facilities shall not include those portions of the system which have been donated or which have been paid for by grants. The connection charge may include interest charges applied from the date of construction of the system until the connection, or for a period not to exceed ten years, whichever is shorter, at a rate commensurate with the rate of interest applicable to the district at the time of construction or major rehabilitation of the system, or at the time of installation of the lines to which the property owner is seeking to connect. In lieu of requiring the installation of permanent local facilities not planned for construction by the district, a district may permit connection to the water and/or sewer systems through temporary facilities installed at the property owner's expense, provided the property owner pays a connection charge consistent with the provisions of this chapter and agrees, in the future, to connect to permanent facilities when they are installed; or a district may permit connection to the water and/or sewer systems through temporary facilities and collect from property owners so connecting a proportionate share of the estimated cost of future local facilities needed to serve the property, as determined by the district. The amount collected, including interest at a rate commensurate with the rate of interest applicable to the district at the time of construction of the temporary facilities, shall be held for contribution to the construction of the permanent local facilities by other developers or the district. The amount collected shall be deemed full satisfaction of the proportionate share of the actual cost of construction of the permanent local facilities. If the permanent local facilities are not constructed within fifteen years of the date of payment, the amount collected, including any accrued interest, shall be returned to the property owner, according to the records of the county auditor on the date of return. If the amount collected is returned to the property owner, and permanent local facilities capable of serving the property are constructed thereafter, the property owner at the time of construction of such permanent local facilities shall pay a proportionate share of the cost of such permanent local facilities, in addition to reasonable connection charges and other charges authorized by this section. A district may permit payment of the cost of connection and the reasonable connection charge to be paid with interest in installments over a period not exceeding fifteen years. The county treasurer may charge and collect a fee of three dollars for each year for the treasurer's services. Those fees shall be a charge to be included as part of each annual installment, and shall be credited to the county current expense fund by the county treasurer. Revenues from connection charges excluding permit fees are to be considered payments in aid of construction as defined by department of revenue rule. Rates or charges for on-site inspection and maintenance services may not be imposed under this chapter on the development, construction, or reconstruction of property.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">Before adopting on-site inspection and maintenance utility services, or incorporating residences into an on-site inspection and maintenance or sewer utility under this chapter, notification must be provided, prior to the applicable public hearing, to all residences within the proposed service area that have on-site systems permitted by the local health officer. The notice must clearly state that the residence is within the proposed service area and must provide information on estimated rates or charges that may be imposed for the service.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">A water-sewer district shall not provide on-site sewage system inspection, pumping services, or other maintenance or repair services under this section using water-sewer district employees unless the on-site system is connected by a publicly owned collection system to the water-sewer district's sewerage system, and the on-site system represents the first step in the sewage disposal process.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">Except as otherwise provided in RCW  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=90.03.525\">90.03.525</a>, any public entity and public property, including the state of Washington and state property, shall be subject to rates and charges for sewer, water, stormwater control, drainage, and street lighting facilities to the same extent private persons and private property are subject to those rates and charges that are imposed by districts.

The commissioners may provide by resolution that where either connection charges or rates and charges for services supplied are delinquent for any specified period of time, the district shall certify the delinquencies to the auditor of the county in which the real property is located, and the charges and any penalties added thereto and interest thereon at the rate of not more than the prime lending rate of the district's bank plus four percentage points per year shall be a lien against the property upon which the service was received, subject only to the lien for general taxes.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(4) The district may, at any time after the connection charges or rates and charges for services supplied or available and penalties are delinquent for a period of 60 days, bring suit in foreclosure by civil action in the superior court of the county in which the real property is located. The court may allow, in addition to the costs and disbursements provided by statute, attorneys' fees, title search and report costs, and expenses as it adjudges reasonable. The action shall be in rem, and may be brought in the name of the district against an individual or against all of those who are delinquent in one action.
