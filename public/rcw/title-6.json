If the garnishee is your employer who owes wages or other personal earnings to you, your employer is required to pay amounts to you that are exempt under state and federal laws, as explained in the writ of garnishment. You should receive a copy of your employer's answer, which will show how the exempt amount was calculated. A garnishment against wages or other earnings for child support may not be issued under chapter  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=6.27\">6.27</a> RCW. If the garnishment is for private student loan debt, the exempt amount paid to you will be the greater of the following: A percent of your disposable earnings, which is eighty-five percent of the part of your earnings remaining after your employer deducts those amounts which are required by law to be withheld, or fifty times the minimum hourly wage of the highest minimum wage law in the state at the time the earnings are payable.

It may be partially exempt even though you have deposited money from other sources in the same account. An exemption is also available under RCW  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=26.16.200\">26.16.200</a>, providing that funds in a community bank account that can be identified as the earnings of a stepparent are exempt from a garnishment on the child support obligation of the parent.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0pt;margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.5in;margin-top:4.5pt;\">OTHER EXEMPTIONS.
