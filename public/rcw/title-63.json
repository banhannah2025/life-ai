Users of personal property of all types and lessors throughout the state have relied upon the distinct nature of leasing as a modern means of transacting business that creates different relationships and legal consequences from those of lender and borrower in loan transactions and those of seller and buyer in installment sale transactions. The utility of lease transactions and the well-being of the state's economy and of the leasing industry require that leasing be a legally recognized and distinct form of transaction, creating legal relationships and having legal consequences different from loans or installment sales.</div>",
