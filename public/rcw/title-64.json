The termination agreement must specify a date after which the agreement will be void unless it is recorded before that date and shall contain a description of the manner in which the creditors of the association will be paid or provided for. A termination agreement and all ratifications thereof must be recorded in every county in which a portion of the condominium is situated and is effective only upon recording. A termination agreement may be amended by complying with all of the requirements of this section.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(3) A termination agreement may provide that all the common elements and units of the condominium shall be sold following termination. If, pursuant to the agreement, any real property in the condominium is to be sold following termination, the termination agreement must set forth the minimum terms of the sale.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(4) The association, on behalf of the unit owners, may contract for the sale of real property in the condominium, but the contract is not binding on the unit owners until approved pursuant to subsections (1) and (2) of this section. If any real property in the condominium is to be sold following termination, title to that real property, upon termination, vests in the association as trustee for the holders of all interests in the units. Thereafter, the association has all powers necessary and appropriate to effect the sale. Until the sale has been concluded and the proceeds thereof distributed, the association continues in existence with all powers it had before termination. Proceeds of the sale must be distributed to unit owners and lienholders as their interests may appear, in proportion to the respective interests of unit owners as provided in subsection (7) of this section. Unless otherwise specified in the termination agreement, as long as the association holds title to the real property, each unit owner and the owner's successors in interest have an exclusive right to occupancy of the portion of the real property that formerly constituted the owner's unit. During the period of that occupancy, each unit owner and the owner's successors in interest remain liable for all assessments and other obligations imposed on unit owners by this chapter or the declaration.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(5) If the real property constituting the condominium is not to be sold following termination, title to all the real property in the condominium vests in the unit owners upon termination as tenants in common in proportion to their respective interests as provided in subsection (7) of this section, and liens on the units shift accordingly. While the tenancy in common exists, each unit owner and the owner's successors in interest have an exclusive right to occupancy of the portion of the real property that formerly constituted the owner's unit.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(6) Following termination of the condominium, the proceeds of any sale of real property, together with the assets of the association, are held by the association as trustee for unit owners and holders of liens on the units and creditors of the association as their interests may appear. No such proceeds or assets may be disbursed to the owners until all of the creditors of the association have been paid or provided for. Following termination, creditors of the association holding liens on the units, which were recorded or perfected under RCW  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=4.64.020\">4.64.020</a> before termination, may enforce those liens in the same manner as any lienholder.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(7) The respective interests of unit owners referred to in subsections (4), (5), and (6) of this section are as follows:</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(a) Except as provided in (b) of this subsection, the respective interests of unit owners are the fair market values of their units, limited common elements, and common element interests immediately before the termination, as determined by one or more independent appraisers selected by the association. The decision of the independent appraisers shall be distributed to the unit owners and becomes final unless disapproved, within thirty days after distribution, by unit owners of units to which twenty-five percent of the votes in the association are allocated. The proportion of any unit owner's interest to that of all unit owners is determined by dividing the fair market value of that unit owner's unit and common element interest by the total fair market values of all the units and common elements.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(b) If any unit or any limited common element is destroyed to the extent that an appraisal of the fair market value thereof before destruction cannot be made, the interests of all unit owners are their respective common element interests immediately before the termination.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(8) Except as provided in subsection (9) of this section, foreclosure or enforcement of a lien or encumbrance against the entire condominium does not of itself terminate the condominium, and foreclosure or enforcement of a lien or encumbrance against a portion of the condominium, other than withdrawable real property, does not withdraw that portion from the condominium. Foreclosure or enforcement of a lien or encumbrance against withdrawable real property does not of itself withdraw that real property from the condominium, but the person taking title thereto has the right to require from the association, upon request, an amendment excluding the real property from the condominium.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(9) If a lien or encumbrance against a portion of the real property that is withdrawable from the condominium has priority over the declaration, and the lien or encumbrance has not been partially released as to a unit, the purchaser at the foreclosure or such purchaser's successors may, upon foreclosure, record an instrument exercising the right to withdraw the real property subject to that lien or encumbrance from the condominium. The board of directors shall reallocate interests as if the foreclosed portion were condemned.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(10) The right of partition under chapter  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=7.52\">7.52</a> RCW shall be suspended if an agreement to sell the property is provided for in the termination agreement pursuant to subsection (3) of this section. The suspension of the right to partition shall continue unless and until no binding obligation to sell exists three months after the recording of the termination agreement, the binding sale agreement is terminated, or one year after the termination agreement is recorded, whichever first occurs.</div>",

If the rental is not paid, the receiver may obtain possession of the unit, refurbish it for rental up to a reasonable standard for rental units in this type of condominium, rent the unit or permit its rental to others, and apply the rents first to the cost of the receivership and attorneys' fees thereof, then to the cost of refurbishing the unit, then to applicable charges, then to costs, fees, and charges of the foreclosure action, and then to the payment of the delinquent assessments. Only a receiver may take possession and collect rents under this subsection, and a receiver shall not be appointed less than 90 days after the delinquency. The exercise by the association of the foregoing rights shall not affect the priority of preexisting liens on the unit.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(11) Except as provided in subsection (3) of this section, the holder of a mortgage or other purchaser of a unit who obtains the right of possession of the unit through foreclosure shall not be liable for assessments or installments thereof that became due prior to such right of possession.

Suit to recover a personal judgment for any delinquent assessment shall be maintainable in any court of competent jurisdiction without foreclosing or waiving the lien securing such sums.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(13) The association may from time to time establish reasonable late charges and a rate of interest to be charged on all subsequent delinquent assessments or installments thereof. In the absence of another established nonusurious rate, delinquent assessments shall bear interest from the date of delinquency at the maximum rate permitted under RCW  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=19.52.020\">19.52.020</a> on the date on which the assessments became delinquent.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(14) The association shall be entitled to recover any costs and reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in connection with the collection of delinquent assessments, whether or not such collection activities result in suit being commenced or prosecuted to judgment. In addition, the association shall be entitled to recover costs and reasonable attorneys' fees if it prevails on appeal and in the enforcement of a judgment.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(15) The association upon written request shall furnish to a unit owner or a mortgagee a statement signed by an officer or authorized agent of the association setting forth the amount of unpaid assessments against that unit.

The person conducting the sale must execute a conveyance to the purchaser sufficient to convey the unit and stating that it is executed by the person after a foreclosure of the association's lien by power of sale and that the person was empowered to make the sale. Signature and title or authority of the person signing the conveyance as grantor and a recital of the facts of nonpayment of the assessment and of the giving of the notices required under this subsection are sufficient proof of the facts recited and of the authority to sign.

The receivership is governed under chapter  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=7.60\">7.60</a> RCW. During pendency of the action, the court may order the receiver to pay sums held by the receiver to the association for any assessments against the unit. The exercise of rights under this subsection by the association does not affect the priority of preexisting liens on the unit.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(16) Except as provided in subsection (3) of this section, the holder of a mortgage or other purchaser of a unit who obtains the right of possession of the unit through foreclosure is not liable for assessments or installments of assessments that became due prior to such right of possession. Such unpaid assessments are deemed to be common expenses collectible from all the unit owners, including such mortgagee or other purchaser of the unit. Foreclosure of a mortgage does not relieve the prior unit owner of personal liability for assessments accruing against the unit prior to the date of such sale as provided in this subsection.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(17) In addition to constituting a lien on the unit, each assessment is the joint and several obligation of the unit owner of the unit to which the same are assessed as of the time the assessment is due. A unit owner may not exempt himself or herself from liability for assessments. In a voluntary conveyance other than by foreclosure, the grantee of a unit is jointly and severally liable with the grantor for all unpaid assessments against the grantor up to the time of the grantor's conveyance, without prejudice to the grantee's right to recover from the grantor the amounts paid by the grantee. Suit to recover a personal judgment for any delinquent assessment is maintainable in any court of competent jurisdiction without foreclosing or waiving the lien securing such sums.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(18) The association may from time to time establish reasonable late charges and a rate of interest to be charged, not to exceed the maximum rate calculated under RCW  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=19.52.020\">19.52.020</a>, on all subsequent delinquent assessments or installments of assessments.

The prevailing party is also entitled to recover costs and reasonable attorneys' fees in such suits, including any appeals, if it prevails on appeal and in the enforcement of a judgment.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(20) To the extent not inconsistent with this section, the declaration may provide for such additional remedies for collection of assessments as may be permitted by law.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(21)(a) When the association mails to the unit owner by first-class mail the first notice of delinquency for past due assessments to the unit address and to any other address that the owner has provided to the association, the association shall include a first preforeclosure notice that states as follows:</div><div style=\"text-align:center;text-indent:0pt;margin-top:4.5pt;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">THIS IS A NOTICE OF DELINQUENCY FOR PAST DUE ASSESSMENTS</span></div><div style=\"text-align:center;text-indent:0pt;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">FROM THE UNIT OWNERS ASSOCIATION TO WHICH YOUR HOME BELONGS.</span></div><div style=\"text-align:center;text-indent:0pt;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">THIS NOTICE IS ONE STEP IN A PROCESS THAT COULD RESULT IN YOUR LOSING YOUR HOME</span>.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0pt;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">CONTACT A HOUSING COUNSELOR OR AN ATTORNEY LICENSED IN WASHINGTON NOW</span> to assess your situation and refer you to mediation if you might benefit. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">DO NOT DELAY</span>.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0pt;\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">BE CAREFUL</span> of people who claim they can help you.

You may encounter certain risks, including being required to pay as a special assessment your share of expenses for the cost of major maintenance, repair, or replacement of a reserve component, as a result of the failure to: (1) Have a current reserve study or fully funded reserves, (2) include a component in a reserve study, or (3) provide any or sufficient contributions to a reserve account for a component.\"</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(f) \"DEPOSITS AND PAYMENTS.

You are not obligated to accept any offer made by the builder or seller.

The extent to which association insurance provides coverage for the benefit of unit owners (including furnishings, fixtures, and equipment in a unit) is determined by the provisions of the declaration and the association's insurance policy, which may be modified from time to time.
