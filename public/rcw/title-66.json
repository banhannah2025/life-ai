If the board makes an initial decision to deny a license or renewal based on the written objections of an incorporated city or town or county legislative authority, the applicant may request a hearing subject to the applicable provisions of Title <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=34\">34</a> RCW. If such a hearing is held at the request of the applicant, board representatives must present and defend the board's initial decision to deny a license or renewal.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(e) Upon the granting of a license under this title the board must send written notification to the chief executive officer of the incorporated city or town in which the license is granted, or to the county legislative authority if the license is granted outside the boundaries of incorporated cities or towns. When the license is for a special occasion license for an event held during a county, district, or area fair as defined by RCW  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=15.76.120\">15.76.120</a>, and the county, district, or area fair is located on county-owned property but located within an incorporated city or town, the written notification must be sent to both the incorporated city or town and the county legislative authority.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(9)(a) Before the board issues any license to any applicant, it shall give (i) due consideration to the location of the business to be conducted under such license with respect to the proximity of churches, schools, and public institutions and (ii) written notice, with receipt verification, of the application to public institutions identified by the board as appropriate to receive such notice, churches, and schools within five hundred feet of the premises to be licensed. The board may not issue a liquor license for either on-premises or off-premises consumption covering any premises not now licensed, if such premises are within five hundred feet of the premises of any tax-supported public elementary or secondary school measured along the most direct route over or across established public walks, streets, or other public passageway from the main entrance of the school to the nearest public entrance of the premises proposed for license, and if, after receipt by the school of the notice as provided in this subsection, the board receives written objection, within twenty days after receiving such notice, from an official representative or representatives of the school within five hundred feet of said proposed licensed premises, indicating to the board that there is an objection to the issuance of such license because of proximity to a school. The board may extend the time period for submitting objections. For the purpose of this section, \"church\" means a building erected for and used exclusively for religious worship and schooling or other activity in connection therewith. For the purpose of this section, \"public institution\" means institutions of higher education, parks, community centers, libraries, and transit centers.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(b) No liquor license may be issued or reissued by the board to any motor sports facility or licensee operating within the motor sports facility unless the motor sports facility enforces a program reasonably calculated to prevent alcohol or alcoholic beverages not purchased within the facility from entering the facility and such program is approved by local law enforcement agencies.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(c) It is the intent under this subsection (9) that a retail license may not be issued by the board where doing so would, in the judgment of the board, adversely affect a private school meeting the requirements for private schools under Title <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=28A\">28A</a> RCW, which school is within five hundred feet of the proposed licensee.

If a license is issued despite the proximity of a private school, the board must state in a letter addressed to the private school the board's reasons for issuing the license.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(10) The restrictions set forth in subsection (9) of this section do not prohibit the board from authorizing the assumption of existing licenses now located within the restricted area by other persons or licenses or relocations of existing licensed premises within the restricted area. In no case may the licensed premises be moved closer to a church or school than it was before the assumption or relocation.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(11)(a) Nothing in this section prohibits the board, in its discretion, from issuing a temporary retail or distributor license to an applicant to operate the retail or distributor premises during the period the application for the license is pending.

A temporary license may be extended at the discretion of the board for additional periods of sixty days upon payment of an additional fee and upon compliance with all conditions required in this section.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(c) Refusal by the board to issue or extend a temporary license shall not entitle the applicant to request a hearing. A temporary license may be canceled or suspended summarily at any time if the board determines that good cause for cancellation or suspension exists.

If an application for a temporary license is withdrawn before issuance or is refused by the board, the fee which accompanied such application must be refunded in full.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(12) In determining whether to grant or deny a license or renewal of any license, the board must give substantial weight to objections from an incorporated city or town or county legislative authority based upon chronic illegal activity associated with the applicant's operations of the premises proposed to be licensed or the applicant's operation of any other licensed premises, or the conduct of the applicant's patrons inside or outside the licensed premises. \"Chronic illegal activity\" means (a) a pervasive pattern of activity that threatens the public health, safety, and welfare of the city, town, or county including, but not limited to, open container violations, assaults, disturbances, disorderly conduct, or other criminal law violations, or as documented in crime statistics, police reports, emergency medical response data, calls for service, field data, or similar records of a law enforcement agency for the city, town, county, or any other municipal corporation or any state agency; or (b) an unreasonably high number of citations for violations of RCW  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=46.61.502\">46.61.502</a> associated with the applicant's or licensee's operation of any licensed premises as indicated by the reported statements given to law enforcement upon arrest.</div>",

At this early stage of the law enforcement consultation process, the board may not be involved in the investigation of the theft allegation until such time as the law enforcement agency has had an opportunity to consult with the licensee's manager or owner as provided under this subsection (3)(a).</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(b) Following the initial consultation between the law enforcement agency and the licensee as required under (a) of this subsection, the law enforcement agency is granted the discretionary authority to forego any further consultation with the licensee and may terminate its investigation of the theft allegation. However, if the law enforcement agency opts to continue the consultation process with the licensee and proceed with its investigation, the law enforcement agency must endeavor to work with the licensee to identify theft issues and reach cooperative agreements regarding measures that should be taken to eliminate spirits theft problems.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(c) If during the consultation process outlined under (a) and (b) of this subsection the law enforcement agency determines that no spirits theft problem exists at the premises of the licensee, or that the licensee has taken the steps necessary to adequately address the theft problem, then the procedural processes outlined in this section may be terminated at the discretion of the law enforcement agency without the involvement of the board. However, if the law enforcement agency finds that a spirits theft problem exists at the licensee's premises and the licensee either refuses or fails to implement remedial measures adequate to address the theft problem, or otherwise fails to cooperate with the law enforcement agency, then the law enforcement agency must formally inform the board in writing regarding the licensee's lack of cooperation in resolving its spirits theft problem.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(d) Upon the receipt of law enforcement agency notification as required under (c) of this subsection, the board must provide written notification to the licensee of the alleged theft problem and may demand that the licensee participate in a consultation process involving a representative of the board and the licensee. The reporting law enforcement agency may be included in this consultation process at the discretion of the board and upon the agreement of the law enforcement agency. The licensee's participation in the consultation process is mandatory and the licensee is entitled to at least thirty days' notice by the board. In the event a licensee fails to attend or otherwise cooperate in initial or subsequent consultations, the board is authorized to suspend the licensee's spirits retail license until such time as the retailer is in compliance with the requirements of this subsection (3)(d).</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(e) At the consultation, the board must provide the licensee with any information or evidence pertinent to any allegation that the retailer has an unacceptable spirits theft rate. The licensee must be provided with a reasonable opportunity to respond and present evidence, and, if necessary, the consultation may be continued at the discretion of the board to allow adequate time for the licensee to prepare such response.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(f) At the conclusion of the initial consultation process, if the board finds that the licensee has an unacceptable spirits theft rate, it may develop a corrective action plan outlining the remedial measures that must be taken by the licensee pursuant to subsection (2) of this section. In developing the plan, the board must make a concerted effort to obtain voluntary participation in the plan by the licensee. At every step in the consultation and corrective action plan process, the board is encouraged to work with the licensee in a cooperative manner and, where possible, to strive for voluntary agreements with the licensee. However, in the absence of licensee cooperation or agreement, the board is authorized to unilaterally develop and enforce a corrective action plan as authorized under this section. Once the plan is finalized, it must be filed with the board and a copy provided to the licensee either personally or through certified mail.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(g) Not more than thirty days after the filing and service of the original corrective action plan, the board must schedule one or more follow-up consultations with the licensee. The purpose of these consultations is to review the licensee's performance with respect to the requirements of the corrective action plan and to generally assess the licensee's progress in addressing spirits theft issues. If the licensee is following the corrective action plan but is continuing to experience an unacceptable spirits theft rate, then the board and the licensee may review and revise the plan as deemed necessary by the board. Following the filing of a revised plan, the board may schedule one or more follow-up consultations at its discretion.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(h) During the review process established in (g) of this subsection, if the board finds that the licensee has failed to comply with the requirements of the original or revised corrective action plan the board may:</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(i) Demand that the licensee take remedial steps so as to be compliant with the corrective action plan and schedule an additional follow-up consultation at the board's discretion; or</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(ii) If the licensee's noncompliance is deemed to be willful, suspend the retailer's spirits retail license for a period to be determined by the board by rule.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(i) If a licensee remains consistently noncompliant with the original corrective action plan and any revised plans for a period of at least nine months, then the board is authorized to suspend or revoke the licensee's spirits retail license.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(4) The board is granted the rule-making authority necessary to implement and enforce the provisions of this section pertaining to the regulation of licensees deemed to have unacceptable spirits theft rates.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(5) If the board suspends or revokes a licensee's spirits retail license under this section, the licensee may appeal and request a hearing under chapter  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=34.05\">34.05</a> RCW, the administrative procedure act.</div>",
