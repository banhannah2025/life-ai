Most recently, the Asian flu in 1957-58 and the Hong Kong flu in 1968-69 killed seventy thousand and thirty-four thousand, respectively, in the United States.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(3) Another influenza pandemic could emerge with little warning, affecting a large number of people. Estimates are that another pandemic influenza would cause more than two hundred thousand deaths in our country, with as many as five thousand in Washington. Our state could also expect ten thousand to twenty-four thousand people needing hospital stays, and as many as a million people requiring outpatient visits. During a severe pandemic these numbers could be much higher. The economic losses could also be substantial.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(4) The current Avian or bird flu that is spreading around the world has the potential to start a pandemic. There is yet no proven vaccine, and antiviral medication supplies are limited and of unknown effectiveness against a human version of the virus, leaving traditional public health measures as the only means to slow the spread of the disease. Given the global nature of a pandemic, as much as possible, the state must be able to respond assuming only limited outside resources and assistance will be available.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(5) An effective response to pandemic influenza in Washington must focus at the local level and will depend on preestablished partnerships and collaborative planning on a range of best case and worst case scenarios. It will require flexibility and real-time decision making, guided by accurate information. It will also depend on a well-informed public that understands the dangers of pandemic influenza and the steps necessary to prevent the spread of the disease.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(6) Avian flu is but one example of an infectious disease that, were an outbreak to occur, could pose a significant statewide health hazard. As such, preparation for pandemic flu will also enhance the capacity of local public health jurisdictions to respond to other emergencies.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">It is therefore the intent of the legislature that adequate pandemic flu preparedness and response plans be developed and implemented by local public health jurisdictions statewide in order to limit the number of illnesses and deaths, preserve the continuity of essential government and other community services, and minimize social disruption and economic loss in the event of an influenza pandemic.</div>",

The requirement of the hospital to inform physicians and other health care providers of the charges of the health care services that they order may have a positive effect on containing health costs. Further, the option of the physician or other health care provider to inform the patient of these charges may strengthen the necessary dialogue in the provider-patient relationship that tends to be diminished by intervening third-party payers.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(2) The chief executive officer of a hospital licensed under this chapter and the superintendent of a state hospital shall establish and maintain a procedure for disclosing to physicians and other health care providers with admitting privileges the charges of all health care services ordered for their patients.

Statutory restrictions have reduced the options available to the director to address the access needs of basic health plan enrollees. It is the intent of the legislature to authorize the director to develop alternative purchasing strategies to ensure access to basic health plan enrollees in all areas of the state, including: (i) The use of differential rating for managed health care systems based on geographic differences in costs; and (ii) limited use of self-insurance in areas where adequate access cannot be assured through other options.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(b) In developing alternative purchasing strategies to address health care access needs, the director shall consult with interested persons including health carriers, health care providers, and health facilities, and with other appropriate state agencies including the office of the insurance commissioner and the office of community and rural health. In pursuing such alternatives, the director shall continue to give priority to prepaid managed care as the preferred method of assuring access to basic health plan enrollees followed, in priority order, by preferred providers, fee-for-service, and self-funding.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(2) The legislature further finds that:</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(a) A significant percentage of the population of this state does not have reasonably available insurance or other coverage of the costs of necessary basic health care services;</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(b) This lack of basic health care coverage is detrimental to the health of the individuals lacking coverage and to the public welfare, and results in substantial expenditures for emergency and remedial health care, often at the expense of health care providers, health care facilities, and all purchasers of health care, including the state; and</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(c) The use of managed health care systems has significant potential to reduce the growth of health care costs incurred by the people of this state generally, and by low-income pregnant women, and at-risk children and adolescents who need greater access to managed health care.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(3) The purpose of this chapter is to provide or make more readily available necessary basic health care services in an appropriate setting to working persons and others who lack coverage, at a cost to these persons that does not create barriers to the utilization of necessary health care services. To that end, this chapter establishes a program to be made available to those residents not eligible for medicare who share in a portion of the cost or who pay the full cost of receiving basic health care services from a managed health care system.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(4) It is not the intent of this chapter to provide health care services for those persons who are presently covered through private employer-based health plans, nor to replace employer-based health plans. However, the legislature recognizes that cost-effective and affordable health plans may not always be available to small business employers. Further, it is the intent of the legislature to expand, wherever possible, the availability of private health care coverage and to discourage the decline of employer-based coverage.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(5)(a) It is the purpose of this chapter to acknowledge the initial success of this program that has (i) assisted thousands of families in their search for affordable health care; (ii) demonstrated that low-income, uninsured families are willing to pay for their own health care coverage to the extent of their ability to pay; and (iii) proved that local health care providers are willing to enter into a public-private partnership as a managed care system.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(b) As a consequence, the legislature intends to extend an option to enroll to certain citizens above two hundred percent of the federal poverty guidelines within the state who reside in communities where the plan is operational and who collectively or individually wish to exercise the opportunity to purchase health care coverage through the basic health plan if the purchase is done at no cost to the state. It is also the intent of the legislature to allow employers and other financial sponsors to financially assist such individuals to purchase health care through the program so long as such purchase does not result in a lower standard of coverage for employees.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(c) The legislature intends that, to the extent of available funds, the program be available throughout Washington state to subsidized and nonsubsidized enrollees. It is also the intent of the legislature to enroll subsidized enrollees first, to the maximum extent feasible.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(d) The legislature directs that the basic health plan director identify enrollees who are likely to be eligible for medical assistance and assist these individuals in applying for and receiving medical assistance.

The *administrator may require that a business owner pay at least an amount equal to what the employee pays after the state pays its portion of the subsidized premium cost of the plan on behalf of each employee enrolled in the plan. Enrollment is limited to those not eligible for medicare who wish to enroll in the plan and choose to obtain the basic health care coverage and services from a managed care system participating in the plan. The *administrator shall adjust the amount determined to be due on behalf of or from all such enrollees whenever the amount negotiated by the *administrator with the participating managed health care system or systems is modified or the administrative cost of providing the plan to such enrollees changes.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(13) To determine the rate to be paid to each participating managed health care system in return for the provision of covered basic health care services to enrollees in the system. Although the schedule of covered basic health care services will be the same or actuarially equivalent for similar enrollees, the rates negotiated with participating managed health care systems may vary among the systems. In negotiating rates with participating systems, the *administrator shall consider the characteristics of the populations served by the respective systems, economic circumstances of the local area, the need to conserve the resources of the basic health plan trust account, and other factors the *administrator finds relevant.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(14) To monitor the provision of covered services to enrollees by participating managed health care systems in order to assure enrollee access to good quality basic health care, to require periodic data reports concerning the utilization of health care services rendered to enrollees in order to provide adequate information for evaluation, and to inspect the books and records of participating managed health care systems to assure compliance with the purposes of this chapter. In requiring reports from participating managed health care systems, including data on services rendered enrollees, the *administrator shall endeavor to minimize costs, both to the managed health care systems and to the plan. The *administrator shall coordinate any such reporting requirements with other state agencies, such as the insurance commissioner and the department of health, to minimize duplication of effort.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(15) To evaluate the effects this chapter has on private employer-based health care coverage and to take appropriate measures consistent with state and federal statutes that will discourage the reduction of such coverage in the state.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(16) To develop a program of proven preventive health measures and to integrate it into the plan wherever possible and consistent with this chapter.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(17) To provide, consistent with available funding, assistance for rural residents, underserved populations, and persons of color.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(18) In consultation with appropriate state and local government agencies, to establish criteria defining eligibility for persons confined or residing in government-operated institutions.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(19) To administer the premium discounts provided under RCW  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=48.41.200\">48.41.200</a>(3)(a) (i) and (ii) pursuant to a contract with the Washington state health insurance pool.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(20) To give priority in enrollment to persons who disenrolled from the program in order to enroll in medicaid, and subsequently became ineligible for medicaid coverage.</div>",

A sentence of confinement in a city or county jail may include placement in a farm or camp. Unless directed otherwise by court order, the chief law enforcement officer or department of corrections, may transfer the prisoner to a farm or camp. The sentencing court, chief law enforcement officer, or department of corrections may not transfer to a farm or camp a greater number of prisoners than can be furnished with constructive employment and can be reasonably accommodated.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(3) The city or county may establish a city or county work release program and housing facilities for the prisoners in the program. In such regard, factors such as employment conditions and the condition of jail facilities should be considered. When a work release program is established the following provisions apply:</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(a) A person convicted of a felony and placed in a city or county jail is eligible for the work release program. A person sentenced to a city or county jail is eligible for the work release program. The program may be used as a condition of probation for a criminal offense. Good conduct is a condition of participation in the program.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(b) The court may permit a person who is currently, regularly employed to continue his or her employment. The chief law enforcement officer or department of corrections shall make all necessary arrangements if possible. The court may authorize the person to seek suitable employment and may authorize the chief law enforcement officer or department of corrections to make reasonable efforts to find suitable employment for the person. A person participating in the work release program may not work in an establishment where there is a labor dispute.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(c) The work release prisoner shall be confined in a work release facility or jail unless authorized to be absent from the facility for program-related purposes, unless the court directs otherwise.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(d) Each work release prisoner's earnings may be collected by the chief law enforcement officer or a designee. The chief law enforcement officer or a designee may deduct from the earnings moneys for the payments for the prisoner's board, personal expenses inside and outside the jail, a share of the administrative expenses of this section, court-ordered victim compensation, and court-ordered restitution. Support payments for the prisoner's dependents, if any, shall be made as directed by the court. With the prisoner's consent, the remaining funds may be used to pay the prisoner's preexisting debts. Any remaining balance shall be returned to the prisoner.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(e) The prisoner's sentence may be reduced by earned early release time in accordance with procedures that shall be developed and promulgated by the work release facility. The earned early release time shall be for good behavior and good performance as determined by the facility. The facility shall not credit the offender with earned early release credits in advance of the offender actually earning the credits. In the case of an offender convicted of a serious violent offense or a sex offense that is a class A felony committed on or after July 1, 1990, the aggregate earned early release time may not exceed fifteen percent of the sentence. In no other case may the aggregate earned early release time exceed one-third of the total sentence.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(f) If the work release prisoner violates the conditions of custody or employment, the prisoner shall be returned to the sentencing court. The sentencing court may require the prisoner to spend the remainder of the sentence in actual confinement and may cancel any earned reduction of the sentence.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(4) A special detention facility may be operated by a noncorrectional agency or by noncorrectional personnel by contract with the governing unit. The employees shall meet the standards of training and education established by the criminal justice training commission as authorized by RCW  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=43.101.080\">43.101.080</a>. The special detention facility may use combinations of features including, but not limited to, low-security or honor prisoner status, work farm, work release, community review, prisoner facility maintenance and food preparation, training programs, or alcohol or drug rehabilitation programs. Special detention facilities may establish a reasonable fee schedule to cover the cost of facility housing and programs. The schedule shall be on a sliding basis that reflects the person's ability to pay.</div>",

The legislature further recognizes that pretreatment services should be provided at locations where chemically dependent women are likely to be found, including public health clinics and domestic violence or homeless shelters.

          "bodyHtml": "<div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(1) The protection of vulnerable residents living in adult family homes and other long-term care facilities in the state is a matter of ongoing concern and grave importance. In 2011, the legislature examined problems with the quality of care and oversight of adult family homes in Washington. The 2011 legislature passed Engrossed Substitute House Bill No. 1277 to address some of these issues, and in addition, created an adult family home quality assurance panel, chaired by the state long-term care ombudsman [ombuds], to meet and make recommendations to the governor and legislature by December 1, 2012, for further improvements in adult family home care and the oversight of the homes by the department of social and health services.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(2) The legislature recognizes that significant progress has been made over the years in adult family home care, and that many adult family homes provide high quality care and are the preferred alternative for many residents in contrast to a larger care facility setting. The legislature finds however that the quality of care in some adult family homes would be improved, and abuse and neglect would decline, if these homes' caregivers and providers received better training and mentoring, residents and their families were more informed and able to select an appropriate home, and oversight by the department of social and health services was more vigorous and prompt against poorly performing homes. It is therefore the intent of the legislature to enact the recommendations included in the adult family home quality assurance panel report in order to improve the quality of care of vulnerable residents and the department's oversight of adult family homes.</div>",

          "bodyHtml": "<div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(1) The legislature finds that chapter 15, Laws of 2019 furthers the public health, safety, and welfare by reducing youth access to addictive and harmful products.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(2) While present state law prohibits the sale and distribution of tobacco and vapor products to youth under the age of eighteen, youth obtain these products with ease.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(3) The legislature recognizes that many people who purchase cigarettes for minors are between the ages of eighteen to twenty. By decreasing the number of eligible buyers in high school, raising the minimum legal age to sell tobacco and vapor products will decrease the access of students to tobacco products. According to the 2014 healthy youth survey, forty-one percent of tenth graders say it is \"sort of easy\" to \"very easy\" to get cigarettes. Nationally, among youth who smoke, more than twice as many get their cigarettes from social sources than from a store or vending machine.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(4) The legislature recognizes that ninety-five percent of smokers start by the age of twenty-one.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(5) The legislature recognizes that jurisdictions across the country are increasing the age of sale for tobacco products to twenty-one. As of October 2018, six states (California, Hawaii, Maine, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and Oregon), the District of Columbia, the territory of Guam, and more than three hundred fifty cities and counties in twenty-one states have raised the minimum legal sales age to twenty-one. Approximately thirty percent of the population of the United States is covered by such a policy.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(6) The legislature recognizes the scientific report issued by the national institute of medicine, one of the most prestigious scientific authorities in the United States, which predicted that increasing the age of sale for tobacco products in the United States to twenty-one will significantly reduce the number of adolescents and young adults who start smoking, reduce deaths from smoking, and immediately improve the health of adolescents, young adults, young mothers, and their children.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(7) The legislature recognizes the national institute of medicine report predicted increasing the tobacco sale age will make the greatest difference among those ages fifteen to seventeen, who will no longer be able to pass for legal age and will have a harder time getting tobacco products from older classmates and friends. The national institute of medicine report also predicted raising the minimum age for the sale of tobacco products in the United States to twenty-one will, over time, reduce the smoking rate by about twelve percent and smoking-related deaths by ten percent.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(8) The legislature recognizes scientific study of the brain is increasingly showing that the brain continues to be highly vulnerable to addictive substances until age twenty-five. Nicotine adversely affects the development of the cerebral cortex and hippocampus in adolescents.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(9) The legislature recognizes that a strategy of increasing the minimum legal age for alcohol was highly successful in reducing adverse effects of alcohol consumption. A national drinking age of twenty-one resulted in reduced alcohol consumption among youth, decreased alcohol dependence, and has led to significant reductions in drunk driving fatalities.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(10) The legislature recognizes that if the age of sale is raised to twenty-one, eighteen to twenty year olds will likely substitute other in-store purchases for cigarettes. The legislature recognizes that when Needham, Massachusetts raised the smoking age to twenty-one in 2005, no convenience stores went out of business.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(11) The legislature recognizes that reducing the youth smoking rate will save lives and reduce health care costs. Every year, two billion eight hundred ten million dollars in health care costs can be directly attributed to tobacco use in Washington. Smoking-caused government expenditures cost every Washington household eight hundred twenty-one dollars per year.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(12) Federal law requires states to enforce laws prohibiting sale and distribution of tobacco products to minors in a manner that can reasonably be expected to reduce the extent to which the products are available to minors. It is imperative to effectively reduce the sale, distribution, and availability of tobacco products to minors.</div>",

The Surgeon General has determined that smoking causes lung cancer, heart disease and other serious diseases, and that there are hundreds of thousands of tobacco-related deaths in the United States each year. These diseases most often do not appear until many years after the person in question begins smoking.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(b) Cigarette smoking also presents serious financial concerns for the State. Under certain health-care programs, the State may have a legal obligation to provide medical assistance to eligible persons for health conditions associated with cigarette smoking, and those persons may have a legal entitlement to receive such medical assistance.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(c) Under these programs, the State pays millions of dollars each year to provide medical assistance for these persons for health conditions associated with cigarette smoking.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(d) It is the policy of the State that financial burdens imposed on the State by cigarette smoking be borne by tobacco product manufacturers rather than by the State to the extent that such manufacturers either determine to enter into a settlement with the State or are found culpable by the courts.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(e) On November 23, 1998, leading United States tobacco product manufacturers entered into a settlement agreement, entitled the \"Master Settlement Agreement,\" with the State. The Master Settlement Agreement obligates these manufacturers, in return for a release of past, present and certain future claims against them as described therein, to pay substantial sums to the State (tied in part to their volume of sales); to fund a national foundation devoted to the interests of public health; and to make substantial changes in their advertising and marketing practices and corporate culture, with the intention of reducing underage smoking.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(f) It would be contrary to the policy of the State if tobacco product manufacturers who determine not to enter into such a settlement could use a resulting cost advantage to derive large, short-term profits in the years before liability may arise without ensuring that the State will have an eventual source of recovery from them if they are proven to have acted culpably. It is thus in the interest of the State to require that such manufacturers establish a reserve fund to guarantee a source of compensation and to prevent such manufacturers from deriving large, short-term profits and then becoming judgment-proof before liability may arise.</div>",

It further finds that it is the duty of the state to create a regulatory environment and health care payment policy that promotes innovation at the local level to provide such care.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">It further declares that it is the responsibility of the state to develop policy that provides direction to local communities with regard to such factors as a definition of health care services, identification of statewide health status outcomes, clarification of state, regional, [and] community responsibilities and interrelationships for assuring access to affordable health care and continued assurances that quality health care services are provided.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(2) The legislature further finds that many rural communities do not operate hospitals in a cost-efficient manner. The cost of operating the rural hospital often exceeds the revenues generated. Some of these hospitals face closure, which may result in the loss of health care services for the community. Many communities are struggling to retain health care services by operating a cost-efficient facility located in the community. Current regulatory laws do not provide for the facilities licensure option that is appropriate for rural areas. A major barrier to the development of an appropriate rural licensure model is federal medicare approval to guarantee reimbursement for the costs of providing care and operating the facility. Medicare certification typically elaborates upon state licensure requirements. Medicare approval of reimbursement is more likely if the state has developed legal criteria for a rural-appropriate health facility. Medicare has begun negotiations with other states facing similar problems to develop exceptions with the goal of allowing reimbursement of rural alternative health care facilities. It is in the best interests of rural citizens for Washington state to begin negotiations with the federal government with the objective of designing a medicare eligible rural health care facility structured to meet the health care needs of rural Washington and be eligible for federal and state financial support for its development and operation.</div>",

The networks have only those powers and duties expressly authorized under this chapter. The networks should empower parents and other citizens by being a means of expressing their attitudes, spirit, and perspectives regarding safe and healthy family and community life. The legislature intends that parent and other citizen perspectives exercise a controlling influence over policy and program operations of professional organizations concerned with children and family issues within networks in a manner consistent with the Constitution and state law. It is not the intent of the legislature that health, social service, or educational professionals dominate community public health and safety network processes or programs, but rather that these professionals use their skills to lend support to parents and other citizens in expressing their values as parents and other citizens identify community needs and establish community priorities. To this end, the legislature intends full participation of parents and other citizens in community public health and safety networks. The intent is that local community values are reflected in the operations of the network.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(2) A group of persons described in subsection (3) of this section may apply to be a community public health and safety network.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(3) Each community public health and safety network shall be composed of twenty-three people, thirteen of whom shall be citizens who live within the network boundary with no fiduciary interest.

The thirteen persons shall be selected as follows: Three by chambers of commerce, three by school board members, three by county legislative authorities, three by city legislative authorities, and one high school student, selected by student organizations. The remaining ten members shall live or work within the network boundary and shall include local representation selected by the following groups and entities: Cities; counties; federally recognized Indian tribes; parks and recreation programs; law enforcement agencies; state children's service workers; employment assistance workers; private social service providers, broad-based nonsecular organizations, or health service providers; and public education.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(4) Each of the twenty-three people who are members of each community public health and safety network must sign an annual declaration under penalty of perjury or a notarized statement that clearly, in plain and understandable language, states whether or not he or she has a fiduciary interest.

The collaborative shall identify health care services for which there are substantial variation in practice patterns or high utilization trends in Washington state, without producing better care outcomes for patients, that are indicators of poor quality and potential waste in the health care system. On an annual basis, the collaborative shall identify up to three health care services it will address.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(2) For each health care service identified, the collaborative shall:</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(a) Analyze and identify evidence-based best practice approaches to improve quality and reduce variation in use of the service, including identification of guidelines or protocols applicable to the health care service. In evaluating guidelines, the collaborative should identify the highest quality guidelines based upon the most rigorous and transparent methods for identification, rating, and translation of evidence into practice recommendations.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(b) Identify data collection and reporting necessary to develop baseline health service utilization rates and to measure the impact of strategies adopted under this section. Methods for data collection and reporting should strive to minimize cost and administrative effort related to data collection and reporting wherever possible, including the use of existing data resources and nonfee-based tools for reporting.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(c) Identify strategies to increase use of the evidence-based best practice approaches identified under (a) of this subsection in both state purchased and privately purchased health care plans. Strategies considered should include, but are not limited to: Identifying goals for appropriate utilization rates and reduction in practice variation among providers; peer-to-peer consultation or second opinions; provider feedback reports; use of patient decision aids; incentives for appropriate use of health care services; centers of excellence or other provider qualification standards; quality improvement systems; and service utilization and outcomes reporting, including public reporting. In developing strategies, the collaborative should strongly consider related efforts of organizations such as the Puget Sound health alliance, the Washington state hospital association, the national quality forum, the joint commission on accreditation of health care organizations, the national committee for quality assurance, the foundation for health care quality, and, where appropriate, more focused quality improvement efforts, such as the Washington state perinatal advisory committee and the Washington state surgical care and outcomes assessment program. The collaborative shall provide an opportunity for public comment on the strategies chosen before finalizing their recommendations.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(3) If the collaborative chooses a health care service for which there is substantial variation in practice patterns or a high or low utilization trend in Washington state, and a lack of evidence-based best practice approaches, it should consider strategies that will promote improved care outcomes, such as patient decision aids, provider feedback reports, centers of excellence or other provider qualification standards, and research to improve care quality and outcomes.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(4) The governor shall appoint twenty members of the collaborative, who must include:</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(a) Two members, selected from health carriers or third-party administrators that have the most fully insured and self-funded covered lives in Washington state.

The collaborative shall not accept private funds if receipt of such funding could present a potential conflict of interest or bias in the collaborative's deliberations. Available state funds may be used to support the work of the collaborative when the collaborative has selected a health care service that is a high utilization or high-cost service in state purchased health care programs or the health care service is undergoing evaluation in one or more state purchased health care programs and coordination will reduce duplication of efforts. The collaborative shall not begin the work described in this section unless sufficient funds are received from private or federal resources, or available state funds.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(11) No member of the collaborative or its committees may be compensated for his or her service.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(12) The proceedings of the collaborative shall be open to the public and notice of meetings shall be provided at least twenty days prior to a meeting.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(13) All meetings of the collaborative, including those of a subcommittee, are subject to the open public meetings act.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(14) The collaborative shall report to the administrator of the authority regarding the health services areas it has chosen and strategies proposed. The administrator shall review the strategies recommended in the report, giving strong consideration to the direction provided in section 1, chapter 313, Laws of 2011 and this section. The administrator's review shall describe the outcomes of the review and any decisions related to adoption of the recommended strategies by state purchased health care programs. Following the administrator's review, the collaborative shall report to the legislature and the governor regarding chosen health services, proposed strategies, the results of the administrator's review, and available information related to the impact of strategies adopted in the previous three years on the cost and quality of care provided in Washington state.

          "bodyHtml": "<div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(1) The legislature finds that all people confined in prisons and detention facilities in Washington deserve basic health care, nutrition, and safety. As held in <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">United States v. California</span>, 921 F.3d 865, 886 (9th Cir. 2019), states possess \"the general authority to ensure the health and welfare of inmates and detainees in facilities within its borders.\" States have broad authority to enforce generally applicable health and safety laws against contractors operating private detention facilities within the state. The ninth circuit reinforced this authority in <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Geo Group, Inc. v. Newsom</span>, 50 F.4th 745, 750 (9th Cir. 2022), stating \"[p]rivate contractors do not stand on the same footing as the federal government, so states can impose many laws on federal contractors that they could not apply to the federal government itself.\"</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(2) The legislature finds that profit motives lead private prisons and detention facilities to cut operational costs, including the provision of food, health care, and rehabilitative services, because their primary fiduciary duty is to maximize shareholder profits. This is in stark contrast to the interests of the state to ensure the health, safety, and welfare of Washingtonians, including all inmates and detainees within Washington's borders.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(3) The legislature finds that people confined in for-profit prisons and detention facilities have experienced abuses and have been confined in dangerous and unsanitary conditions. Safety risks and abuses in private prisons and detention facilities at the local, state, and federal level have been consistently and repeatedly documented. The United States department of justice office of the inspector general found in 2016 that privately operated prisons \"incurred more safety and security incidents per capita than comparable BOP [federal bureau of prisons] institutions.\" The office of inspector general additionally found that privately operated prisons had higher rates of staff uses of force and that people detained in private prisons submitted more safety and security related grievances, including those regarding the quality of food.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(4) The legislature finds that private prison operators have cut costs by reducing essential security and health care staffing. The sentencing project, a national research and advocacy organization, found in 2012 that private prison staff earn an average of five thousand dollars less than staff at publicly run facilities and receive almost 60 hours less training. The office of inspector general also found that people confined in private facilities often failed to receive necessary medical care and that one private prison went without a full-time physician for eight months. People confined within private detention facilities are subjected to prolonged periods of confinement, inadequate nutrition, medical and mental health access issues, and arbitrary and improper visitation and communication restrictions. In 2018, the sentencing project, a national research and advocacy organization, found that private prisons offer lower quality services and have higher staff turnover rates compared to publicly operated facilities. The office of inspector general also found that people confined in private facilities often failed to receive necessary medical care.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(5) The legislature finds that private prisons and detention centers are less accountable for what happens inside those facilities than state-run facilities, as they are not subject to the freedom of information act under 5 U.S.C. Sec. 552 or the Washington public records act under chapter  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=42.56\">42.56</a> RCW.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(6) The legislature finds that at least 22 other states have stopped confining people in private for-profit facilities.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(7) Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to prohibit the use of private, for-profit prisons and detention facilities in the state, and to set minimum standards for the conditions of confinement within private detention facilities in the state and to require the inspection and review of those facilities by appropriate state or local agencies to ensure public health and safety.</div>",
