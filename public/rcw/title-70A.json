          "bodyHtml": "<div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(1) The purpose of this chapter is to reduce environmental and health disparities in Washington state and improve the health of all Washington state residents. This chapter implements the recommendations of the environmental justice task force established in section 221(48), chapter 415, Laws of 2019 entitled \"Report to the Washington state governor and legislature, <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Environmental Justice Task Force: Recommendations for Prioritizing EJ in Washington State Government</span> (October 2020).\"</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(2) As conveyed in the task force report, Washington state studies and national studies found that people of color and low-income people continue to be disproportionately exposed to environmental harms in their communities. As a result, there is a higher risk of adverse health outcomes for those communities. This risk is amplified when overlaid on communities with preexisting social and economic barriers and environmental risks, and creates cumulative environmental health impacts, which chapter 314, Laws of 2021 seeks to prevent and mitigate.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">This chapter also seeks to reduce exposure to environmental hazards within Indian country, as defined in 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1151, due to off-reservation activities within the state, and to improve state practices to reduce contamination of traditional foods wherever they occur. Exposure to such hazards can result in generational health and ecological problems, particularly on small reservations where it is impossible to move away from a hazard.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(3) Accordingly, the state has a compelling interest in preventing and addressing such environmental health disparities in the administration of ongoing and new environmental programs, including allocation of funds, and in administering these programs so as to remedy the effects of past disparate treatment of overburdened communities and vulnerable populations.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(4) The task force provided recommendations to state agencies for measurable goals and model policies to reduce environmental health inequities in Washington, equitable practices for meaningful community involvement, and how to use the environmental health disparities map to identify and promote the equitable distribution of environmental benefits to overburdened communities. In order for all communities in Washington state to be healthy and thriving, state government should aim to concentrate government actions to benefit communities that currently have the greatest environmental and health burdens.</div>",

Air is an essential resource that must be protected from harmful levels of pollution. Improving air quality is a matter of statewide concern and is in the public interest. It is the intent of this chapter to secure and maintain levels of air quality that protect human health and safety, including the most sensitive members of the population, to comply with the requirements of the federal clean air act, to prevent injury to plant, animal life, and property, to foster the comfort and convenience of Washington's inhabitants, to promote the economic and social development of the state, and to facilitate the enjoyment of the natural attractions of the state.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">It is further the intent of this chapter to protect the public welfare, to preserve visibility, to protect scenic, aesthetic, historic, and cultural values, and to prevent air pollution problems that interfere with the enjoyment of life, property, or natural attractions.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">Because of the extent of the air pollution problem the legislature finds it necessary to return areas with poor air quality to levels adequate to protect health and the environment as expeditiously as possible but no later than December 31, 1995.

In selecting air pollution control strategies state and local agencies shall support those strategies that lessen the negative environmental impact of the project on all environmental media, including air, water, and land.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">The legislature further recognizes that energy efficiency and energy conservation can help to reduce air pollution and shall therefore be considered when making decisions on air pollution control strategies and projects.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">It is the policy of the state that the costs of protecting the air resource and operating state and local air pollution control programs shall be shared as equitably as possible among all sources whose emissions cause air pollution.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">It is also declared as public policy that regional air pollution control programs are to be encouraged and supported to the extent practicable as essential instruments for the securing and maintenance of appropriate levels of air quality.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">To these ends it is the purpose of this chapter to safeguard the public interest through an intensive, progressive, and coordinated statewide program of air pollution prevention and control, to provide for an appropriate distribution of responsibilities, and to encourage coordination and cooperation between the state, regional, and local units of government, to improve cooperation between state and federal government, public and private organizations, and the concerned individual, as well as to provide for the use of all known, available, and reasonable methods to reduce, prevent, and control air pollution.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">The legislature recognizes that the problems and effects of air pollution cross political boundaries, are frequently regional or interjurisdictional in nature, and are dependent upon the existence of human activity in areas having common topography and weather conditions conducive to the buildup of air contaminants. In addition, the legislature recognizes that air pollution levels are aggravated and compounded by increased population, and its consequences. These changes often result in increasingly serious problems for the public and the environment.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">The legislature further recognizes that air emissions from thousands of small individual sources are major contributors to air pollution in many regions of the state.

It is declared to be the policy of the state to achieve significant reductions in emissions from those small sources whose aggregate emissions constitute a significant contribution to air pollution in a particular region.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">It is the intent of the legislature that air pollution goals be incorporated in the missions and actions of state agencies.</div>",

This air pollution causes significant harm to public health, causes damage to trees, plants, structures, and materials and degrades the quality of the environment.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">Increasing automotive traffic is also aggravating traffic congestion in Washington's metropolitan areas. This traffic congestion imposes significant costs on Washington's businesses, governmental agencies, and individuals in terms of lost working hours and delays in the delivery of goods and services. Traffic congestion worsens automobile-related air pollution, increases the consumption of fuel, and degrades the habitability of many of Washington's cities and suburban areas. The capital and environmental costs of fully accommodating the existing and projected automobile traffic on roads and highways are prohibitive. Decreasing the demand for vehicle trips is significantly less costly and at least as effective in reducing traffic congestion and its impacts as constructing new transportation facilities such as roads and bridges, to accommodate increased traffic volumes.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">The legislature also finds that increasing automotive transportation is a major factor in increasing consumption of gasoline and, thereby, increasing reliance on imported sources of petroleum. Moderating the growth in automotive travel is essential to stabilizing and reducing dependence on imported petroleum and improving the nation's energy security.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">The legislature further finds that reducing the number of commute trips to work made via single-occupant cars and light trucks is an effective way of reducing automobile-related air pollution, traffic congestion, and energy use. Major employers have significant opportunities to encourage and facilitate reducing single-occupant vehicle commuting by employees. In addition, the legislature also recognizes the importance of increasing individual citizens' awareness of air quality, energy consumption, and traffic congestion, and the contribution individual actions can make towards addressing these issues.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">The intent of this chapter is to require local governments in those counties experiencing the greatest automobile-related air pollution and traffic congestion to develop and implement plans to reduce single-occupant vehicle commute trips. Such plans shall require major employers and employers at major worksites to implement programs to reduce single-occupant vehicle commuting by employees at major worksites. Local governments in counties experiencing significant but less severe automobile-related air pollution and traffic congestion may implement such plans. State agencies shall implement programs to reduce single-occupant vehicle commuting at all major worksites throughout the state.</div>",

The legislature further intends to allocate future distributions of energy-related federal jobs stimulus funding to strengthen these programs, and to coordinate energy retrofit and rehabilitation improvements as authorized by chapter 287, Laws of 2010 to increase the number of structures qualifying for assistance under these multiple state and federal energy efficiency programs.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(3) The program implementing the policy of this chapter is necessary to support the poor and infirm and also to benefit the health, safety, and general welfare of all citizens of the state.</div>",

          "caption": "Findings—Intent.",
          "bodyHtml": "<div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(1) The legislature finds that climate change is one of the greatest challenges facing our state and the world today, an existential crisis with major negative impacts on environmental and human health. Washington is experiencing environmental and community impacts due to climate change through increasingly devastating wildfires, flooding, droughts, rising temperatures and sea levels, and ocean acidification. Greenhouse gas emissions already in the atmosphere will increase impacts for some period of time. Actions to increase resilience of our communities, natural resource lands, and ecosystems can prevent and reduce impacts to communities and our environment and improve their ability to recover.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(2) In 2020, the legislature updated the state's greenhouse gas emissions limits that are to be achieved by 2030, 2040, and 2050, based on current science and emissions trends, to support local and global efforts to avoid the most significant impacts from climate change. Meeting these limits will require coordinated, comprehensive, and multisectoral implementation of policies, programs, and laws, as other enacted policies are insufficient to meet the limits.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(3) The legislature further finds that while climate change is a global problem, there are communities that have historically borne the disproportionate impacts of environmental burdens and that now bear the disproportionate negative impacts of climate change. Although the state has done significant work in the past to highlight these environmental health disparities, beginning with senator Rosa Franklin's environmental equity study, and continuing through the work of the governor's interagency council on health disparities, the creation of the Washington environmental health disparities map, and recommendations of the environmental justice task force, the state can do much more to ensure that state programs address environmental equity.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(4) The legislature further finds that while enacted carbon policies can be well-intended to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and provide environmental benefits to communities, the policies may not do enough to ensure environmental health disparities are reduced and environmental benefits are provided to those communities most impacted by environmental harms from greenhouse gas and air pollutant emissions.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(5) The legislature further finds that wildfires have become one of the largest sources of black carbon in the last five years. From 2014 through 2018, wildfires in Washington state generated 39,200,000 metric tons of carbon, the equivalent of more than 8,500,000 cars on the road a year. In 2015, when 1,130,000 acres burned in Washington, wildfires were the second largest source of greenhouse gas emissions releasing 17,975,112 metric tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Wildfire pollution affects all Washingtonians, but has disproportionate health effects on low-income communities, communities of color, and the most vulnerable of our population. Restoring the health of our forests and investing in wildfire prevention and preparedness will therefore contribute to improved air quality and improved public health outcomes.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(6) The legislature further finds that by exercising a leadership role in addressing climate change, Washington will position its economy, technology centers, financial institutions, and manufacturers to benefit from national and international efforts that must occur to reduce greenhouse gases. The legislature intends to create climate policy that recognizes the special nature of emissions-intensive, trade-exposed industries by minimizing leakage and increased life-cycle emissions associated with product imports. The legislature further finds that climate policies must be appropriately designed, in order to avoid leakage that results in net increases in global greenhouse gas emissions and increased negative impacts to those communities most impacted by environmental harms from climate change. The legislature further intends to encourage these industries to continue to innovate, find new ways to be more energy efficient, use lower carbon products, and be positioned to be global leaders in a low carbon economy.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(7) Under the program, the legislature intends to identify overburdened communities where the highest concentrations of criteria pollutants occur, determine the sources of those emissions and pollutants, and pursue significant reductions of emissions and pollutants in those communities. The legislature further intends for the department of ecology to conduct environmental justice assessments to ensure that funds and programs created under this chapter provide direct and meaningful benefits to vulnerable populations and overburdened communities. Additionally, the legislature intends to prevent job loss and provide protective measures if workers are adversely impacted by the transition to a clean energy economy through transition and assistance programs, worker-support projects, and workforce development and other activities designed to grow and expand the clean manufacturing sector in communities across Washington state. The legislature further intends to empower the environmental justice council established under RCW  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=70A.02.110\">70A.02.110</a> to provide recommendations for the development and implementation of the program, the distribution of funds, and the establishment of programs, activities, and projects to achieve environmental justice and environmental health goals. The legislature further intends for the department of ecology to create and adopt community engagement plans and tribal consultation frameworks in the administration of the program to ensure equitable practices for meaningful community and federally recognized tribal involvement. Finally, the legislature intends to establish this program to contribute to a healthy environment for all of Washington's communities.</div>",

          "bodyHtml": "<div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(1) The legislature finds that historically governmental and nongovernmental water purveyors have played two key public service roles: Providing safe drinking water and providing water for fire protection. This dual function approach is a deeply embedded and state-regulated feature of water system planning, engineering, operation, and maintenance. This dual function enables purveyors to provide these critical public services in a cost-effective way that protects public health and safety, promotes economic development, and supports appropriate land use planning.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(2) The legislature finds that the provision of integrated, dual function water facilities and services benefits all customers of a purveyor, similar to other benefits provided to water system customers in response to regulation regarding safe drinking water such as treatment and water quality monitoring.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(3) The legislature finds that water purveyors plan, construct, acquire, operate, and maintain fire suppression water facilities in response to regulatory requirements, including without limitation the public water system coordination act, RCW  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=70A.100.080\">70A.100.080</a>, the design of public water systems and water system operations requirements, chapter 246-290 WAC, Parts 3 and 5, the state building code, chapter  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=19.27\">19.27</a> RCW, and the international fire code. The availability of infrastructure and water to fight fires allows for the development and habitability of property, increases property values, and benefits customers and property through lower casualty insurance rates.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(4) The legislature finds that recent Washington supreme court decisions, including <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">Lane v. City of Seattle</span>, 164 Wn.2d 875 (2008), and <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">City of Tacoma v. City of Bonney Lake, et al.,</span> 173 Wn.2d 584 (2012), have created uncertainty and confusion as to the role, responsibilities, cost allocation, and recovery authority of water purveyors. If left unresolved, the absence of legal clarity will adversely affect the availability and condition of fire suppression infrastructure necessary to protect life and property.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(5) It is the legislature's intent to determine appropriate methods of organizing public services and the authority of water purveyors with respect to critical public services. The legislature further intends this chapter to clarify the authority of water purveyors to provide fire suppression water facilities and services and to recover the costs for those facilities and services. The legislature also intends to provide liability protections appropriate for water purveyors engaged in this vital public service.</div>",

It is therefore necessary to change manufacturing and purchasing practices and waste generation behaviors to reduce the amount of waste that becomes a governmental responsibility.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(5) Source separation of waste must become a fundamental strategy of solid waste management. Collection and handling strategies should have, as an ultimate goal, the source separation of all materials with resource value or environmental hazard.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(6)(a) It should be the goal of every person and business to minimize their production of wastes and to separate recyclable or hazardous materials from mixed waste.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(b) It is the responsibility of state, county, and city governments to provide for a waste management infrastructure to fully implement waste reduction and source separation strategies and to process and dispose of remaining wastes in a manner that is environmentally safe and economically sound. It is further the responsibility of state, county, and city governments to monitor the cost-effectiveness and environmental safety of combusting separated waste, processing mixed municipal solid waste, and recycling programs.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(c) It is the responsibility of county and city governments to assume primary responsibility for solid waste management and to develop and implement aggressive and effective waste reduction and source separation strategies.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(d) It is the responsibility of state government to ensure that local governments are providing adequate source reduction and separation opportunities and incentives to all, including persons in both rural and urban areas, and nonresidential waste generators such as commercial, industrial, and institutional entities, recognizing the need to provide flexibility to accommodate differing population densities, distances to and availability of recycling markets, and collection and disposal costs in each community; and to provide county and city governments with adequate technical resources to accomplish this responsibility.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(7) Environmental and economic considerations in solving the state's solid waste management problems requires strong consideration by local governments of regional solutions and intergovernmental cooperation.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(8) The following priorities for the collection, handling, and management of solid waste are necessary and should be followed in descending order as applicable:</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(a) Waste reduction;</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(b) Recycling, with source separation of recyclable materials as the preferred method;</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(c) Energy recovery, incineration, or landfill of separated waste;</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(d) Energy recovery, incineration, or landfill of mixed municipal solid wastes.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(9) It is the state's goal to achieve a fifty percent recycling rate by 2007.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(10) It is the state's goal that programs be established to eliminate residential or commercial yard debris in landfills by 2012 in those areas where alternatives to disposal are readily available and effective.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(11) Steps should be taken to make recycling at least as affordable and convenient to the ratepayer as mixed waste disposal.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(12) It is necessary to compile and maintain adequate data on the types and quantities of solid waste that are being generated and to monitor how the various types of solid waste are being managed.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(13) Vehicle batteries should be recycled and the disposal of vehicle batteries into landfills or incinerators should be discontinued.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(14) Excessive and nonrecyclable packaging of products should be avoided.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(15) Comprehensive education should be conducted throughout the state so that people are informed of the need to reduce, source separate, and recycle solid waste.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(16) All governmental entities in the state should set an example by implementing aggressive waste reduction and recycling programs at their workplaces and by purchasing products that are made from recycled materials and are recyclable.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(17) To ensure the safe and efficient operations of solid waste disposal facilities, it is necessary for operators and regulators of landfills and incinerators to receive training and certification.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(18) It is necessary to provide adequate funding to all levels of government so that successful waste reduction and recycling programs can be implemented.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(19) The development of stable and expanding markets for recyclable materials is critical to the long-term success of the state's recycling goals.

In order to address this problem in the most cost-effective and environmentally sound manner, and to implement the highest waste management priority as articulated in RCW  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=70A.205.005\">70A.205.005</a> and  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=70A.300.260\">70A.300.260</a>, public and private efforts should focus on reducing the generation of waste. Waste reduction can be achieved by encouraging voluntary efforts to redesign industrial, commercial, production, and other processes to result in the reduction or elimination of waste by-products and to maximize the in-process reuse or reclamation of valuable spent material.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">In the interest of protecting the public health, safety, and the environment, the legislature declares that it is the policy of the state of Washington to encourage reduction in the use of hazardous substances and reduction in the generation of hazardous waste whenever economically and technically practicable.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">The legislature finds that hazardous wastes are generated by numerous different sources including, but not limited to, large and small business, households, and state and local government. The legislature further finds that a goal against which efforts at waste reduction may be measured is essential for an effective hazardous waste reduction program. The Pacific Northwest hazardous waste advisory council has endorsed a goal of reducing, through hazardous substance use reduction and waste reduction techniques, the generation of hazardous waste by fifty percent by 1995. The legislature adopts this as a policy goal for the state of Washington. The legislature recognizes that many individual businesses have already reduced the generation of hazardous waste through appropriate hazardous waste reduction techniques. The legislature also recognizes that there are some basic industrial processes which by their nature have limited potential for significantly reducing the use of certain raw materials or substantially reducing the generation of hazardous wastes. Therefore, the goal of reducing hazardous waste generation by fifty percent cannot be applied as a regulatory requirement.</div>",

The legislature finds that there is a statewide interest in assuring that such facilities can be sited.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">It is therefore the intent of the legislature to preempt local government's authority to approve, deny, or otherwise regulate disposal and incineration facilities, and to vest in the department of ecology the sole authority among state, regional, and local agencies to approve, deny, and regulate preempted facilities, as defined in this chapter.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">In addition, it is the intent of the legislature that such complete preemptive authority also be vested in the department for treatment and storage facilities, in addition to disposal and incineration facilities, if a local government fails to carry out its responsibilities established in RCW  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=70A.300.370\">70A.300.370</a>.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">It is further the intent of the legislature that no local ordinance, permit requirement, other requirement, or decision shall prohibit on the basis of land use considerations the construction of a hazardous waste management facility within any zone designated and approved in accordance with this chapter, provided that the proposed site for the facility is consistent with applicable state siting criteria.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(9) With the exception of the disposal site authorized for acquisition under this chapter, the private sector has had the primary role in providing hazardous waste management facilities and services in the state. It is the intent of the legislature that this role be encouraged and continue into the future to the extent feasible. Whether privately or publicly owned and operated, hazardous waste management facilities and services should be subject to strict governmental regulation as provided under this chapter.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(10) Wastes that are exempt or excluded from full regulation under this chapter due to their small quantity or household origin have the potential to pose significant risk to public health and the environment if not properly managed. It is the intent of the legislature that the specific risks posed by such waste be investigated and assessed and that programs be carried out as necessary to manage the waste appropriately. In addition, the legislature finds that, because local conditions vary substantially in regard to the quantities, risks, and management opportunities available for such wastes, local government is the appropriate level of government to plan for and carry out programs to manage moderate-risk waste, with assistance and coordination provided by the department.</div>",

The beneficial stewardship of the land, air, and waters of the state is a solemn obligation of the present generation for the benefit of future generations.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(2) A healthful environment is now threatened by the irresponsible use and disposal of hazardous substances. There are hundreds of hazardous waste sites in this state, and more will be created if current waste practices continue. Hazardous waste sites threaten the state's water resources, including those used for public drinking water. Many of our municipal landfills are current or potential hazardous waste sites and present serious threats to human health and environment. The costs of eliminating these threats in many cases are beyond the financial means of our local governments and ratepayers. The main purpose of chapter 2, Laws of 1989 is to raise sufficient funds to clean up all hazardous waste sites and to prevent the creation of future hazards due to improper disposal of toxic wastes into the state's land and waters.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(3) Many farmers and small business owners who have followed the law with respect to their uses of pesticides and other chemicals nonetheless may face devastating economic consequences because their uses have contaminated the environment or the water supplies of their neighbors.

Each party state shall cooperate with the other party states in determining the appropriate site of any facility that might be required within the region comprised of the party states, in order to maximize public health and safety while minimizing the use of any one party state as the host of such facilities on a permanent basis. Each party state further agrees that decisions regarding low-level waste management facilities in their region will be reached through a good faith process which takes into account the burdens borne by each of the party states as well as the benefits each has received.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">Section 5. The party states recognize that the issue of hazardous chemical waste management is similar in many respects to that of low-level waste management. Therefore, in consideration of the state of Washington allowing access to its low-level waste disposal facility by generators in other party states, party states such as Oregon and Idaho which host hazardous chemical waste disposal facilities will allow access to such facilities by generators within other party states. Nothing in this compact may be construed to prevent any party state from limiting the nature and type of hazardous chemical or low-level wastes to be accepted at facilities within its borders or from ordering the closure or [of] such facilities, so long as such action by a host state is applied equally to all generators within the region composed of the party states.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">Section 6.

Levels of PBDEs are increasing in people, and in the environment, particularly in North America. Because people can be exposed to these chemicals through house dust and indoor air as well as through food, it is important to phase out their use in common household products, provided that effective flame retardants that are safer and technically feasible are available at a reasonable cost.</div>",

          "bodyHtml": "<div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(1) The legislature finds that lead hazards associated with lead-based paint represent a significant and preventable environmental health problem. Lead-based paint is the most widespread of the various sources of lead exposure to the public. Census data show that 1,560,000 homes in Washington state were built prior to 1978 when the sale of residential lead-based paint was banned. These are homes that are believed to contain some lead-based paint.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">Lead negatively affects every system of the body. It is harmful to individuals of all ages and is especially harmful to children, fetuses, and adults of childbearing age. The effects of lead on a child's cognitive, behavioral, and developmental abilities may necessitate large expenditures of public funds for health care and special education. The irreversible damage to children and subsequent expenditures could be avoided if exposure to lead is reduced.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(2) The federal government regulates lead poisoning and lead hazard reduction through:</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(a)(i) The lead-based paint poisoning prevention act;</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(ii) The lead contamination control act;</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(iii) The safe drinking water act;</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(iv) The resource conservation and recovery act of 1976; and</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(v) The residential lead-based paint hazard reduction act of 1992; and</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(b) Implementing regulations of:</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(i) The environmental protection agency;</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(ii) The department of housing and urban development;</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(iii) The occupational safety and health administration; and</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(iv) The centers for disease control and prevention.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(3) In 1992, congress passed the federal residential lead-based paint hazard reduction act, which allows states to provide for the accreditation of lead-based paint activities programs, the certification of persons completing such training programs, and the licensing of lead-based paint activities contractors under standards developed by the United States environmental protection agency.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(4) The legislature recognizes the state's need to protect the public from exposure to lead hazards. A qualified and properly trained workforce is needed to assist in the prevention, detection, reduction, and elimination of hazards associated with lead-based paint. The purpose of training workers, supervisors, inspectors, risk assessors, project designers, renovators, and dust sampling technicians engaged in lead-based paint activities is to protect building occupants, particularly children under the age of six years from potential lead-based paint hazards and exposures both during and after lead-based paint activities. Qualified and properly trained individuals and firms will help to ensure lead-based paint activities are conducted in a way that protects the health of the citizens of Washington state and safeguards the environment.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(5) The state lead-based paint activities program requires that all lead-based paint activities be performed by certified personnel trained by an accredited program, and that all lead-based paint activities meet minimum work practice standards established by the department of commerce. Therefore, the lead-based paint activities accreditation, training, and certification program shall be established in accordance with this chapter. The lead-based paint activities accreditation, training, and certification program shall be administered by the department of commerce and shall be used as a means to assure the protection of the general public from exposure to lead hazards.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(6) For the welfare of the people of the state of Washington, this chapter establishes a lead-based paint activities program within the department of commerce to protect the general public from exposure to lead hazards and to ensure the availability of a trained and qualified workforce to identify and address lead-based paint hazards.</div>",

People are exposed to lead fragments and dust when lead wheel weights fall from motor vehicles onto Washington roadways and are then abraded and pulverized by traffic. Lead wheel weights on and alongside roadways can contribute to soil, surface, and groundwater contamination and pose hazards to downstream aquatic life.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(2) Lead negatively affects every bodily system. While it is injurious to people of all ages, lead is especially harmful to fetuses, children, and adults of childbearing age. Effects of lead on a child's cognitive, behavioral, and developmental abilities may necessitate large expenditures of public funds for health care and special education. Irreversible damage to children and subsequent expenditures could be avoided if exposure to lead is reduced.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(3) There are no federal regulatory controls governing use of lead wheel weights.

Exposure can occur well after it has been disturbed and long distances from where the asbestos release occurred.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">The purpose of this chapter is to allow people to make informed decisions regarding whether or not they purchase or use building materials containing asbestos.

          "bodyHtml": "<div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">The legislature finds that:</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(1) Leftover architectural paints are a waste management issue and present environmental risks and health and safety risks, especially to workers in the solid waste industry. During waste collection and processing, wet paint can create spills and splashes and oil paint containers may rupture, releasing fumes hazardous to workers and the remaining liquids may contribute to leachate problems in landfills. Some local governments are able to devote resources to provide collection sites or events for latex paint in order to provide their residents with at least some disposal options and to keep latex paint out of the solid waste stream. But residents and small businesses need additional and more convenient options for disposal of architectural paint. Drying latex for disposal is difficult for many residents and is wasteful of latex paint that can otherwise be reused or recycled. Local government special and moderate-risk waste collection programs are heavily impacted by the cost of managing unwanted architectural paints and these costs decrease the available funds to address other hazardous and hard-to-handle materials.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(2) Nationally, an estimated average of ten percent of architectural paint purchased becomes leftover paint. Current programs only collect a fraction of the potential leftover paint for proper reuse, recycling, or disposal. There is not a comprehensive statewide, end-of-life management plan for architectural paint, resulting in significant missed opportunities to reduce, reuse, and recycle paint.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(3)(a) It is in the best interest of Washington for paint manufacturers to assume responsibility for the development and implementation of a cost-effective paint stewardship program that:</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(i) Develops and implements strategies to reduce the generation of leftover paint;</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(ii) Promotes the reuse of leftover paint;</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(iii) Collects, transports, and processes leftover paint for end-of-life management, including reuse, recycling, energy recovery, and disposal; and</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(iv) Provides for transparency under chapter  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=42.56\">42.56</a> RCW, the public records act.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(b) A paint stewardship program will follow the paint waste management hierarchy for managing and reducing leftover paint in the order as follows:</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(i) Reduce consumer generation of leftover paint;</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(ii) Reuse;</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(iii) Recycle; and</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(iv) Provide for energy recovery and disposal.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(c) The establishment of a comprehensive leftover paint management program that requires paint manufacturers to assume responsibility for the collection, recycling, reuse, transportation, and disposal of leftover paint, and that allows paint retailers to voluntarily participate in the collection of leftover paint, will provide more opportunities for consumers to properly manage their leftover paint, provide fiscal relief for local government in managing leftover paint, keep paint out of the waste stream, and conserve natural resources.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(4) The legislature further finds that Washington's existing waste collection, recycling, and disposal system leads the nation in innovation and environmentally sound practices. This system has achieved some of the highest overall recycling rates in the nation at fifty-one percent in 2012. The legislature further finds that leftover paint may be a toxic and hard-to-handle waste product that is appropriate for a product stewardship program to increase the safe, convenient, and effective reuse, recycling, and disposal of leftover paint. Product stewardship programs for toxic and hard-to-handle materials, including an architectural paint stewardship program, should integrate with and complement the existing waste collection, recycling, and disposal system.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(5) This chapter creates an architectural paint stewardship program to be enforced by the department.</div>",

          "bodyHtml": "<div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(1) State policy has long placed waste reduction as the highest priority in the collection, handling, and management of solid waste. Reducing plastic bag waste holds particular importance among state waste reduction efforts for a number of reasons:</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(a) Single-use plastic carryout bags are made of nonrenewable resources and never biodegrade; instead, over time, they break down into tiny particles. Single-use plastic carryout bags, and the particles they break into, are carried into rivers, lakes, Puget Sound, and the world's oceans, posing a threat to animal life and the food chain;</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(b) Plastic bags are one of the most commonly found items that litter state roads, beaches, and other public spaces; and</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(c) Even when plastic bags avoid the common fate of becoming litter, they are a drain on public resources and a burden on environment and resource conservation goals. For example, if plastic bags are disposed of in commingled recycling systems rather than as garbage or in retailer drop-off programs, they clog processing and sorting machinery, resulting in missorted materials and costly inefficiencies that are ultimately borne by utility ratepayers. Likewise, when green or brown-tinted plastic bags confuse consumers into attempting to dispose of them as compost, the resultant plastic contamination undercuts the ability to use the compost in gardens, farms, landscaping, and surface water and transportation projects.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(2) Alternatives to single-use plastic carryout bags are convenient, functional, widely available, and measure as superior across most environmental performance metrics. Alternatives to single-use plastic carryout bags feature especially superior environmental performance with respect to litter and marine debris, since plastic bags do not biodegrade.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(3) As of 2020, many local governments in Washington have shown leadership in regulating the use of single-use plastic carryout bags. This local leadership has shown the value of establishing state standards that will streamline regulatory inconsistency and reduce burdens on covered retailers caused by a patchwork of inconsistent local requirements across the state.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(4) Data provided from grocery retailers has shown that requests for paper bags have skyrocketed where plastic bag bans have been implemented. To accommodate the anticipated consequences of a statewide plastic bag ban, it is rational to expect additional capacity will be needed in Washington state for manufacturing paper bags. The legislature intends to provide that capacity by prioritizing and expediting siting and permitting of expansions or reconfiguring for paper manufacturing.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(5) Therefore, in order to reduce waste, litter, and marine pollution, conserve resources, and protect fish and wildlife, it is the intent of the legislature to:</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(a) Prohibit the use of single-use plastic carryout bags;</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(b) Require a pass-through charge on compliant paper carryout bags and reusable carryout bags made of film plastic, to encourage shoppers to bring their own reusable carryout bags;</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(c) Require that bags provided by a retail establishment contain recycled content or derive from nonwood renewable fiber; and</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(d) Encourage the provision of reusable and compliant paper carryout bags by retail establishments.</div>",

In order to help prompt the use of clean fuels, other states have successfully implemented programs that reduce the carbon intensity of their transportation fuels. California and Oregon have both implemented low carbon fuel standards that are similar to the program created in chapter 317, Laws of 2021, and both states have experienced biofuel sector growth and have successfully sited large biofuel projects that had originally been planned for Washington. Washington state has extensively studied the potential impact of a clean fuels program, and most projections show that a low carbon fuel standard would decrease greenhouse gas and conventional air pollutant emissions, while positively impacting the state's economy.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(2) The legislature further finds that the health and welfare of the people of the state of Washington is threatened by the prospect of crumbling or swamped coastlines, rising water, and more intense forest fires caused by higher temperatures and related droughts, all of which are intensified and made more frequent by the volume of greenhouse gas emissions. As of 2017, the transportation sector contributes 45 percent of Washington's greenhouse gas emissions, and the legislature's interest in the life cycle of the fuels used in the state arises from a concern for the effects of the production and use of these fuels on Washington's environment and public health, including its air quality, snowpack, and coastline.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(3) Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to support the deployment of clean transportation fuel technologies through a carefully designed program that reduces the carbon intensity of fuel used in Washington, in order to:</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(a) Reduce levels of conventional air pollutants from diesel and gasoline that are harmful to public health;</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(b) Reduce greenhouse gas emissions associated with transportation fuels, which are the state's largest source of greenhouse gas emissions; and</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(c) Create jobs and spur economic development based on innovative clean fuel technologies.</div>",

Furthermore, it is appropriate for larger batteries used in emerging market sectors such as electric vehicles, solar power arrays, and data centers, to be managed to ensure environmentally positive outcomes similar to those achieved by a battery stewardship program, both because of the potential economic value of large batteries used for these purposes and the anticipated profusion of these larger batteries as these market sectors mature.</div>",
