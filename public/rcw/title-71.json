Notice and a copy of the terms of conditional release shall be provided at least thirty days before the person is released from inpatient care. Within twenty days after receiving notice, the prosecuting attorney may petition the court in the county that issued the commitment order to hold a hearing to determine whether the person may be conditionally released and the terms of the conditional release. The prosecuting attorney shall provide a copy of the petition to the superintendent or professional person in charge of the hospital or facility providing involuntary treatment, the attorney, if any, and guardian or conservator of the committed person, and the court of original commitment. If the county in which the committed person is to receive outpatient treatment is the same county in which the criminal charges against the committed person were dismissed, then the court shall, upon the motion of the prosecuting attorney, transfer the proceeding to the court in that county. The court shall conduct a hearing on the petition within ten days of the filing of the petition. The committed person shall have the same rights with respect to notice, hearing, and counsel as for an involuntary treatment proceeding, except as set forth in this subsection and except that there shall be no right to jury trial. The issue to be determined at the hearing is whether or not the person may be conditionally released without substantial danger to other persons, or substantial likelihood of committing criminal acts jeopardizing public safety or security. If the court disapproves of the conditional release, it may do so only on the basis of substantial evidence. Pursuant to the determination of the court upon the hearing, the conditional release of the person shall be approved by the court on the same or modified conditions or the person shall be returned for involuntary treatment on an inpatient basis subject to release at the end of the period for which he or she was committed, or otherwise in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(2) The facility or agency designated to provide outpatient care or the secretary of the department of social and health services may modify the conditions for continued release when such modification is in the best interest of the person.

The agency, facility, or designated crisis responder must determine that:</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(a) The person is failing to adhere to the terms and conditions of the order;</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(b) Substantial deterioration in the person's functioning has occurred;</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(c) There is evidence of substantial decompensation with a reasonable probability that the decompensation can be reversed by further evaluation, intervention, or treatment; or</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(d) The person poses a likelihood of serious harm.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(2) Actions taken under this section must include a flexible range of responses of varying levels of intensity appropriate to the circumstances and consistent with the interests of the individual and the public in personal autonomy, safety, recovery, and compliance. Available actions may include, but are not limited to, any of the following:</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(a) To counsel or advise the person as to their rights and responsibilities under the court order, and to offer incentives to motivate compliance;</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(b) To increase the intensity of outpatient services provided to the person by increasing the frequency of contacts with the provider, referring the person for an assessment for assertive community services, or by other means;</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(c) To request a court hearing for review and modification of the court order. The request must be directed to the court with jurisdiction over the order and specify the circumstances that give rise to the request and what modification is being sought. The county prosecutor shall assist the entity requesting the hearing and issue an appropriate summons to the person. This subsection does not limit the inherent authority of a treatment provider to alter conditions of treatment for clinical reasons, and is intended to be used only when court intervention is necessary or advisable to secure the person's compliance and prevent decompensation or deterioration;</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(d) To detain the person for up to 12 hours for evaluation at an agency, facility providing services under the court order, crisis stabilization unit, 23-hour crisis relief center, emergency department, evaluation and treatment facility, secure withdrawal management and stabilization facility with available space, or an approved substance use disorder treatment program with available space. The purpose of the evaluation is to determine whether modification, revocation, or commitment proceedings are necessary and appropriate to stabilize the person and prevent decompensation, deterioration, or physical harm. Temporary detention for evaluation under this subsection is intended to occur only following a pattern of noncompliance or the failure of reasonable attempts at outreach and engagement, and may occur only when, based on clinical judgment, temporary detention is appropriate. The agency, facility, or designated crisis responder may request assistance from a peace officer for the purposes of temporary detention under this subsection (2)(d). This subsection does not limit the ability or obligation of the agency, facility, or designated crisis responder to pursue revocation procedures under subsection (5) of this section in appropriate circumstances; and</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(e) To initiate revocation procedures under subsection (5) of this section.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(3) A court may supervise a person on an order for less restrictive alternative treatment or a conditional release.

The designated crisis responder or secretary of the department of social and health services shall file a petition for revocation within 24 hours and serve the person, their guardian, if any, and their attorney. A hearing for revocation of a less restrictive alternative treatment order or conditional release order may be scheduled without detention of the person.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(b) A person detained under this subsection (5) must be held until such time, not exceeding five days, as a hearing can be scheduled to determine whether or not the order for less restrictive alternative treatment or conditional release should be revoked, modified, or retained. If the person is not detained, the hearing must be scheduled within five days of service on the person. The designated crisis responder or the secretary of the department of social and health services may withdraw its petition for revocation at any time before the court hearing.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(c) A person detained under this subsection (5) has the same rights with respect to notice, hearing, and counsel as in any involuntary treatment proceeding, except as specifically set forth in this section. There is no right to jury trial. The venue for proceedings is the county where the petition is filed. Notice of the filing must be provided to the court that originally ordered commitment, if different from the court where the petition for revocation is filed, within two judicial days of the person's detention.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(d) The issues for the court to determine are whether: (i) The person adhered to the terms and conditions of the order; (ii) substantial deterioration in the person's functioning has occurred; (iii) there is evidence of substantial decompensation with a reasonable probability that the decompensation can be reversed by further inpatient treatment; or (iv) there is a likelihood of serious harm; and, if any of the above conditions apply, whether it is appropriate for the court to reinstate or modify the person's less restrictive alternative treatment order or conditional release order or order the person's detention for inpatient treatment. The person may waive the court hearing and allow the court to enter a stipulated order upon the agreement of all parties. If the court orders detention for inpatient treatment, the treatment period must be for 14 days from the revocation hearing if the less restrictive alternative treatment order or conditional release order was based on a petition under RCW  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=71.05.148\">71.05.148</a>,  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=71.05.160\">71.05.160</a>, or  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=71.05.230\">71.05.230</a>.

A court may not detain a person for inpatient treatment to a secure withdrawal management and stabilization facility or approved substance use disorder treatment program under this subsection unless there is a facility or program available with adequate space for the person.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(6) In determining whether or not to take action under this section the designated crisis responder, agency, or facility must consider the factors specified under RCW  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=71.05.212\">71.05.212</a> and the court must consider the factors specified under RCW  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=71.05.245\">71.05.245</a> as they apply to the question of whether to enforce, modify, or revoke a court order for involuntary treatment.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(7) Prior to taking any action to enforce, modify, or revoke a less restrictive alternative treatment order or conditional release order in which the agency, facility, or designated crisis responder knows, or has reason to know, that the individual is an American Indian or Alaska Native who receives medical or behavioral health services from a tribe within this state, the agency, facility, or designated crisis responder shall notify the tribe and Indian health care provider regarding any action that will be taken under this section as soon as possible, but no later than three hours from the time the decision to take action is made. The agency, facility, or designated crisis responder must provide the tribe and Indian health care provider with a copy of the petition, together with any orders issued by the court and a notice of the tribe's right to intervene as soon as possible, but before any hearing under this section, and no later than 24 hours from the time the petition is served upon the person and the person's guardian. The court clerk shall provide copies of any court orders necessary for the agency, facility, or designated crisis responder to provide notice to the tribe or Indian health care provider under this section.

In contrast to persons appropriate for civil commitment under chapter  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=71.05\">71.05</a> RCW, sexually violent predators generally have personality disorders and/or mental abnormalities which are unamenable to existing mental illness treatment modalities and those conditions render them likely to engage in sexually violent behavior. The legislature further finds that sex offenders' likelihood of engaging in repeat acts of predatory sexual violence is high. The existing involuntary commitment act, chapter  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=71.05\">71.05</a> RCW, is inadequate to address the risk to reoffend because during confinement these offenders do not have access to potential victims and therefore they will not engage in an overt act during confinement as required by the involuntary treatment act for continued confinement. The legislature further finds that the prognosis for curing sexually violent offenders is poor, the treatment needs of this population are very long term, and the treatment modalities for this population are very different than the traditional treatment modalities for people appropriate for commitment under the involuntary treatment act.</div>",

The prosecuting agency shall have a right to a current evaluation of the person by experts chosen by the state. The judge may require the person to complete any or all of the following procedures or tests if requested by the evaluator: (i) A clinical interview; (ii) psychological testing; (iii) plethysmograph testing; and (iv) polygraph testing. The judge may order the person to complete any other procedures and tests relevant to the evaluation. The state is responsible for the costs of the evaluation.

The recommitment proceeding shall otherwise proceed as set forth in RCW  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=71.09.050\">71.09.050</a> and  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=71.09.060\">71.09.060</a>.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(d) If the issue at the hearing is whether the person should be conditionally released to a less restrictive alternative, the burden of proof at the hearing shall be upon the state to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that conditional release to any proposed less restrictive alternative either: (i) Is not in the best interest of the committed person; or (ii) does not include conditions that would adequately protect the community. Evidence of the prior commitment trial and disposition is admissible.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(4)(a) Probable cause exists to believe that a person's condition has \"so changed,\" under subsection (2) of this section, only when evidence exists, since the person's last commitment trial, or less restrictive alternative revocation proceeding, of a substantial change in the person's physical or mental condition such that the person either no longer meets the definition of a sexually violent predator or that a conditional release to a less restrictive alternative is in the person's best interest and conditions can be imposed to adequately protect the community.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(b) A new trial proceeding under subsection (3) of this section may be ordered, or a trial proceeding may be held, only when there is current evidence from a licensed professional of one of the following and the evidence presents a change in condition since the person's last commitment trial proceeding:</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(i) An identified physiological change to the person, such as paralysis, stroke, or dementia, that renders the committed person unable to commit a sexually violent act and this change is permanent; or</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(ii) A change in the person's mental condition brought about through positive response to continuing participation in treatment which indicates that the person meets the standard for conditional release to a less restrictive alternative or that the person would be safe to be at large if unconditionally released from commitment.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(c) For purposes of this section, a change in a single demographic factor, without more, does not establish probable cause for a new trial proceeding under subsection (3) of this section. As used in this section, a single demographic factor includes, but is not limited to, a change in the chronological age, marital status, or gender of the committed person.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(5) When the court enters an order for unconditional discharge of a person from an immediately preceding less restrictive placement, the court must direct the clerk to transmit a copy of the order to the department of corrections for discharge process and termination of cause.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(6) The jurisdiction of the court over a person civilly committed pursuant to this chapter continues until such time as the person is unconditionally discharged.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(7) During any period of confinement pursuant to a criminal conviction, or for any period of detention awaiting trial on criminal charges, this section is suspended.</div>",

The legislature intends to encourage the development of regional behavioral health services with adequate local flexibility to assure eligible people in need of care access to the least-restrictive treatment alternative appropriate to their needs, and the availability of treatment components to assure continuity of care. The legislature hereby finds and declares that sound fiscal management requires vigilance to ensure that funds appropriated by the legislature for the provision of needed community behavioral health system services are ultimately expended solely for the purpose for which they were appropriated, and not for any other purpose.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">It is further the intent of the legislature to integrate the provision of services to provide continuity of care through all phases of treatment. To this end, the legislature intends to promote active engagement with persons with mental illness and collaboration between families and service providers.</div>",

Recovery navigator programs must serve and prioritize individuals who are actually or potentially exposed to the criminal legal system with respect to unlawful behavior connected to substance use or other behavioral health issues.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(3) By June 30, 2024, the authority shall revise its uniform program standards for behavioral health administrative services organizations to follow in the design of their recovery navigator programs to achieve fidelity with the core principles. The uniform program standards must be modeled upon the components of the law enforcement assisted diversion program and address project management, field engagement, biopsychosocial assessment, intensive case management and care coordination, stabilization housing when available and appropriate, and, as necessary, legal system coordination for participants' legal cases that may precede or follow referral to the program. The uniform program standards must incorporate the law enforcement assisted diversion framework for diversion at multiple points of engagement with the criminal legal system, including prearrest, prebooking, prefiling, and for ongoing case conferencing with law enforcement, prosecutors, community stakeholders, and program case managers. The authority must adopt the uniform program standards from the components of the law enforcement assisted diversion program to accommodate an expanded population of persons with substance use disorders, including persons with co-occurring substance use disorders and mental health conditions, provide for referrals from a broad range of sources, and require prioritization of those who are or likely will be exposed to the criminal legal system related to their behavioral health challenges. In addition to accepting referrals from law enforcement and courts of limited jurisdiction, the uniform program standards must provide guidance for accepting referrals on behalf of persons with substance use disorders, including persons with co-occurring substance use disorders and mental health conditions, from various sources including, but not limited to, self-referral, family members of the individual, emergency department personnel, persons engaged with serving homeless persons, including those living unsheltered or in encampments, fire department personnel, emergency medical service personnel, community-based organizations, members of the business community, harm reduction program personnel, faith-based organization staff, and other sources within the criminal legal system, so that individuals are engaged as early as possible within the sequential intercept model. In developing response time requirements within the statewide program standards, the authority shall require, subject to the availability of amounts appropriated for this specific purpose, that responses to referrals from law enforcement occur immediately for in-custody referrals and shall strive for rapid response times to other appropriate settings such as emergency departments and courts of limited jurisdiction.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(4) Subject to the availability of amounts appropriated for this specific purpose, the authority shall provide funding to each behavioral health administrative services organization for the continuation of and, as required by this section, the revisions to and reorganization of the recovery navigator programs they fund. Before receiving funding for implementation and ongoing administration, each behavioral health administrative services organization must submit a program plan that demonstrates the ability to fully comply with statewide program standards. The authority shall establish a schedule for the regular review of recovery navigator programs funded by behavioral health administrative services organizations. The authority shall arrange for technical assistance to be provided by the LEAD national support bureau to all behavioral health administrative services organizations, the authority, contracted providers, and independent stakeholders and partners, such as prosecuting attorneys and law enforcement.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(5) Each behavioral health administrative services organization must have a substance use disorder regional administrator for its recovery navigator program. The regional administrator shall be responsible for assuring compliance with program standards, including staffing standards. Each recovery navigator program must maintain a sufficient number of appropriately trained personnel for providing intake and referral services, conducting comprehensive biopsychosocial assessments, providing intensive case management services, and making warm handoffs to treatment and recovery support services along the continuum of care. Program staff must include people with lived experience with substance use disorder to the extent possible. The substance use disorder regional administrator must assure that staff who are conducting intake and referral services and field assessments are paid a livable and competitive wage and have appropriate initial training and receive continuing education.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(6) Each recovery navigator program must submit quarterly reports to the authority with information identified by the authority and the substance use recovery services advisory committee. The reports must be provided to the substance use recovery services advisory committee for discussion at meetings following the submission of the reports.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(7) No civil liability may be imposed by any court on the state or its officers or employees, an appointed or elected official, public employee, public agency as defined in RCW  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=4.24.470\">4.24.470</a>, combination of units of government and its employees as provided in RCW  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=36.28A.010\">36.28A.010</a>, nonprofit community-based organization, tribal government entity, tribal organization, or urban Indian organization, based on the administration of a recovery navigator program except upon proof of bad faith or gross negligence.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(8) For the purposes of this section, the term \"core principles\" means the core principles of a law enforcement assisted diversion program, as established by the law enforcement assisted diversion national support bureau in its toolkit, as it existed on July 1, 2023.</div>",

          "bodyHtml": "<div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(1) It is the purpose of this chapter to assure that minors in need of behavioral health care and treatment receive an appropriate continuum of culturally relevant care and treatment, including prevention and early intervention, self-directed care, parent-directed care, and involuntary treatment. To facilitate the continuum of care and treatment to minors in out-of-home placements, all divisions of the authority and the department that provide behavioral health services to minors shall jointly plan and deliver those services.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(2) It is also the purpose of this chapter to protect the rights of adolescents to confidentiality and to independently seek services for behavioral health disorders. Mental health and substance use disorder professionals shall guard against needless hospitalization and deprivations of liberty, enable treatment decisions to be made in response to clinical needs in accordance with sound professional judgment, and encourage the use of voluntary services. Mental health and substance use disorder professionals shall, whenever clinically appropriate, offer less restrictive alternatives to inpatient treatment. Additionally, all behavioral health care and treatment providers shall assure that minors' parents are given an opportunity to participate in the treatment decisions for their minor children. The behavioral health care and treatment providers shall, to the extent possible, offer services that involve minors' parents or family.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(3)(a) It is the intent of the legislature to enhance continuity of care for minors with serious behavioral health disorders that can be controlled or stabilized in a less restrictive alternative commitment. Within the guidelines stated in <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">In re LaBelle</span>, 107 Wn.2d 196 (1986), the legislature intends to encourage appropriate interventions at a point when there is the best opportunity to restore the minor to or maintain satisfactory functioning.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(b) For minors with a prior history or pattern of repeated hospitalizations or law enforcement interventions due to decompensation, the consideration of prior behavioral health history is particularly relevant in determining whether the minor would receive, if released, such care as is essential for his or her health or safety.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(c) Therefore, the legislature finds that for minors who are currently under a commitment order, a prior history of decompensation leading to repeated hospitalizations or law enforcement interventions should be given great weight in determining whether a new less restrictive alternative commitment should be ordered. The court must also consider any school behavioral issues, the impact on the family, the safety of other children in the household, and the developmental age of the minor.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(4) It is also the purpose of this chapter to protect the health and safety of minors suffering from behavioral health disorders and to protect public safety through use of the parens patriae and police powers of the state.
