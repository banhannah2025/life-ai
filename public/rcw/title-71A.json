If a provider fails to submit a plan of correction for approval by the department, the department may impose civil penalties as described in this subsection starting ten days after the provider received the statement of deficiency.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(5) When determining the appropriate enforcement action or actions under subsection (3) of this section, the department must select actions commensurate with the seriousness of the harm or threat of harm to the persons being served by the provider. Further, the department may take enforcement actions that are more severe for violations that are uncorrected, repeated, pervasive, or which present a serious threat of harm to the health, safety, or welfare of persons served by the provider. By January 1, 2016, the department shall by rule develop criteria for the selection and implementation of enforcement actions authorized in subsection (3) of this section.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(6) If the department orders a stop placement, the provider may not accept any new clients until the stop placement order is terminated. If the department orders a limited stop placement, the provider may not accept clients with specific needs or at a specific site until the limited stop placement order is terminated. The department shall terminate the stop placement or limited stop placement when:</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(a) The violations necessitating the stop placement or limited stop placement have been corrected; and</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(b) The provider exhibits the capacity to maintain correction of the violations previously found. However, if upon revisiting the provider, the department finds new violations that the department reasonably believes will result in a new stop placement or new limited stop placement, the previous stop placement or limited stop placement remains in effect until the new stop placement or new limited stop placement is imposed.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(7) After a department finding of a violation for which a stop placement or limited stop placement has been imposed, the department shall make an on-site revisit of the provider within fifteen working days from the date the provider notifies the department of the correction to ensure correction of the violation. For violations that are serious, recurring, or uncorrected following a previous citation and that create actual or threatened harm to one or more clients' well-being, including violations of clients' rights, the department shall make an on-site revisit as soon as appropriate to ensure correction of the violation. Verification of correction of all other violations may be made by either a department on-site revisit or by written or photographic documentation found by the department to be credible. This subsection does not prevent the department from enforcing certification suspensions or revocations. Nothing in this subsection interferes with or diminishes the department's authority and duty to ensure that a provider adequately cares for clients, including making departmental on-site revisits as needed to ensure that the provider protects clients and enforcing compliance with this chapter.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(8) The provisions of chapter  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=34.05\">34.05</a> RCW apply to enforcement actions under this section. The certified provider or its designee has the right to an informal dispute resolution process to dispute any violation found or enforcement remedy imposed by the department during a certification inspection or complaint investigation. The purpose of the informal dispute resolution process is to provide an opportunity for an exchange of information that may lead to the modification, deletion, or removal of a violation, parts of a violation, or an enforcement remedy imposed by the department. Except for the imposition of civil penalties, the effective date of enforcement actions may not be delayed or suspended pending any hearing or informal dispute resolution process.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(9) The enforcement actions and penalties authorized in this section are not exclusive or exhaustive and nothing in this section prohibits the department from taking any other action authorized in statute, rule, or under the terms of a contract with the provider.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(10) A separate residential services and support account is created in the custody of the state treasurer. All receipts from civil penalties imposed under this section must be deposited into the account. Only the director or the director's designee may authorize expenditures from the account. The account is subject to allotment procedures under chapter  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=43.88\">43.88</a> RCW, but an appropriation is not required for expenditures.
