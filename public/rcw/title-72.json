The system should be designed and managed to provide the maximum feasible safety for the persons and property of the general public, the staff, and the inmates.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(2) The system should punish the offender for violating the laws of the state of Washington.

Idleness is not only wasteful but destructive to the individual and to the community.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(b) Adoption of the work ethic.

The individual who works to improve himself or herself and the community should be rewarded for these efforts. As a corollary, there should be no rewards for no effort.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(e) Sharing in the obligations of the community. All citizens, the public and inmates alike, have a personal and fiscal obligation in the corrections system. All communities must share in the responsibility of the corrections system.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(6) The system should provide for prudent management of resources. The avoidance of unnecessary or inefficient public expenditures on the part of offenders and the department is essential. Offenders must be accountable to the department, and the department to the public and the legislature. The human and fiscal resources of the community are limited. The management and use of these resources can be enhanced by wise investment, productive programs, the reduction of duplication and waste, and the joining together of all involved parties in a common endeavor. Since most offenders return to the community, it is wise for the state and the communities to make an investment in effective rehabilitation programs for offenders and the wise use of resources.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(7) The system should provide for restitution. Those who have damaged others, persons or property, have a responsibility to make restitution for these damages.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(8) The system should be accountable to the citizens of the state. In return, the individual citizens and local units of government must meet their responsibilities to make the corrections system effective.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(9) The system should meet those national standards which the state determines to be appropriate.</div>",

          "bodyHtml": "<div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">The people of the state of Washington expect to live in safe communities in which the threat of crime is minimized. Attempting to keep communities safe by building more prisons and paying the costs of incarceration has proven to be expensive to taxpayers. Incarceration is a necessary consequence for some offenders, however, the vast majority of those offenders will eventually return to their communities. Many of these former offenders will not have had the opportunity to address the deficiencies that may have contributed to their criminal behavior. Persons who do not have basic literacy and job skills, or who are ill-equipped to make the behavioral changes necessary to successfully function in the community, have a high risk of reoffense. Recidivism represents serious costs to victims, both financial and nonmonetary in nature, and also burdens state and local governments with those offenders who recycle through the criminal justice system.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">The legislature believes that recidivism can be reduced and a substantial cost savings can be realized by utilizing evidence-based, research-based, and promising programs to address offender deficits, developing and better coordinating the reentry efforts of state and local governments and local communities. Research shows that if quality assurances are adhered to, implementing an optimal portfolio of evidence-based programming options for offenders who are willing to take advantage of such programs can have a notable impact on recidivism.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">While the legislature recognizes that recidivism cannot be eliminated and that a significant number of offenders are unwilling or unable to work to develop the tools necessary to successfully reintegrate into society, the interests of the public overall are better served by better preparing offenders while incarcerated, and continuing those efforts for those recently released from prison or jail, for successful, productive, and healthy transitions to their communities. Educational, employment, and treatment opportunities should be designed to address individual deficits and ideally give offenders the ability to function in society. In order to foster reintegration, chapter 483, Laws of 2007 recognizes the importance of a strong partnership between the department of corrections, local governments, law enforcement, social service providers, and interested members of communities across our state.</div>",

A reentry plan is developed collaboratively between the supervising authority and the offender and based on an assessment of the offender using a standardized and comprehensive tool to identify the offenders' risks and needs. An individual reentry plan describes actions that should occur to prepare individual offenders for release from jail or prison and specifies the supervision and/or services he or she will experience in the community, taking into account no contact provisions of the judgment and sentence. An individual reentry plan should be updated throughout the period of an offender's incarceration and supervision to be relevant to the offender's current needs and risks.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(4) \"Local community policing and supervision programs\" include probation, work release, jails, and other programs operated by local police, courts, or local correctional agencies.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(5) \"Promising practice\" means a practice that presents, based on preliminary information, potential for becoming a research-based or consensus-based practice.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(6) \"Research-based\" means a program or practice that has some research demonstrating effectiveness, but that does not yet meet the standard of evidence-based practices.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(7) \"Supervising authority\" means the agency or entity that has the responsibility for supervising an offender.</div>",
