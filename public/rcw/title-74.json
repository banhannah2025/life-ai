In order to provide students with the opportunity to become responsible citizens, to contribute to their own economic well-being and to that of their families and communities, and to enjoy productive and satisfying lives, the state recognizes the importance that access to appropriate health services and improved health brings to the children of Washington state. In addition, fully immunized children are themselves protected, and in turn protect others, from contracting communicable diseases;</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(c) Children with health insurance coverage have better health outcomes than those who lack coverage. Children without health insurance coverage are more likely to be in poor health and more likely to delay receiving, or go without, needed health care services;</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(d) Health care coverage for children in Washington state is the product of critical efforts in both the private and public sectors to help children succeed. Private health insurance coverage is complemented by public programs that meet needs of low-income children whose parents are not offered health insurance coverage through their employer or who cannot otherwise afford the costs of coverage. In 2006, thirty-five percent of children in Washington state had some form of public health coverage. Washington state is making progress in its efforts to increase the number of children with health care coverage. Yet, even with these efforts of both private and public sectors, many children in Washington state continue to lack health insurance coverage. In 2006, over seventy thousand children were uninsured. Almost two-thirds of these children are in families whose income is under two hundred fifty percent of the federal poverty level; and</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(e) Improved health outcomes for the children of Washington state are the expected result of improved access to health care coverage. Linking children with a medical home that provides preventive and well child health services and referral to needed specialty services, linking children with needed behavioral health and dental services, more effectively managing childhood diseases, improving nutrition, and increasing physical activity are key to improving children's health. Care should be provided in appropriate settings by efficient providers, consistent with high quality care and at an appropriate stage, soon enough to avert the need for overly expensive treatment.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(2) It is therefore the intent of the legislature that:</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(a) All children in the state of Washington have health care coverage by 2010. This should be accomplished by building upon and strengthening the successes of private health insurance coverage and publicly supported children's health insurance programs in Washington state. Access to coverage should be streamlined and efficient, with reductions in unnecessary administrative costs and mechanisms to expeditiously link children with a medical home;</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(b) The state, in collaboration with parents, schools, communities, health plans, and providers, take steps to improve health outcomes for the children of Washington state by linking children with a medical home, identifying health improvement goals for children, and linking innovative purchasing strategies to those goals.</div>",

To the extent allowable under federal law, the authority shall require families to enroll in available employer-sponsored coverage, as a condition of participating in the program established under this section, when it is cost-effective for the state to do so.

          "bodyHtml": "<div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">The legislature finds that:</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(1) Health care costs are growing rapidly, exceeding the consumer price index year after year. Consequently, state health programs are capturing a growing share of the state budget, even as state revenues have declined. Sustaining these critical health programs will require actions to effectively contain health care cost increases in the future; and</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(2) The primary care health home model has been demonstrated to successfully constrain costs, while improving quality of care. Chronic care management, occurring within a primary care health home, has been shown to be especially effective at reducing costs and improving quality. However, broad adoption of these models has been impeded by a fee-for-service system that reimburses volume of services and does not adequately support important primary care health home services, such as case management and patient outreach. Furthermore, successful implementation will require a broad adoption effort by private and public payers, in coordination with providers.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">Therefore the legislature intends to promote the adoption of primary care health homes for children and adults and, within them, advance the practice of chronic care management to improve health outcomes and reduce unnecessary costs. To facilitate the best coordination and patient care, primary care health homes are encouraged to collaborate with other providers currently outside the medical insurance model. Successful chronic care management for persons receiving long-term care services in addition to medical care will require close coordination between primary care providers, long-term care workers, and other long-term care service providers, including area agencies on aging. Primary care providers also should consider oral health coordination through collaboration with dental providers and, when possible, delivery of oral health prevention services. The legislature also intends that the methods and approach of the primary care health home become part of basic primary care medical education.</div>",

The legislature further finds that access to maternity care for low-income women in the state of Washington has declined significantly in recent years and has reached a crisis level.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(2) It is the purpose of this subchapter to provide, consistent with appropriated funds, maternity care necessary to ensure healthy birth outcomes for low-income families. To this end, a maternity care access system is established based on the following principles:</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(a) The family is the fundamental unit in our society and should be supported through public policy.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(b) Access to maternity care for eligible persons to ensure healthy birth outcomes should be made readily available in an expeditious manner through a single service entry point.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(c) Unnecessary barriers to maternity care for eligible persons should be removed.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(d) Access to preventive and other health care services should be available for low-income children.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(e) Each woman should be encouraged to and assisted in making her own informed decisions about her maternity care.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(f) Unnecessary barriers to the provision of maternity care by qualified health professionals should be removed.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(g) The system should be sensitive to cultural differences among eligible persons.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(h) To the extent possible, decisions about the scope, content, and delivery of services should be made at the local level involving a broad representation of community interests.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(i) The maternity care access system should be evaluated at appropriate intervals to determine effectiveness and need for modification.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(j) Maternity care services should be delivered in a cost-effective manner.</div>",

Reasonable efforts by the department to shorten out-of-home placement or avoid it altogether should be a major focus of the child welfare system.

The legislature also intends that these services be used for those families whose children are returning to the home from out-of-home care.

The increasing workload of courts, prosecuting attorneys, and the attorney general has made such remedies uncertain, slow and inadequate, thereby resulting in a growing burden on the financial resources of the state, which is constrained to provide public assistance grants for basic maintenance requirements when parents fail to meet their primary obligations. The state of Washington, therefore, exercising its police and sovereign power, declares that the common law and statutory remedies pertaining to family desertion and nonsupport of minor dependent children shall be augmented by additional remedies directed to the real and personal property resources of the responsible parents. In order to render resources more immediately available to meet the needs of minor children, it is the legislative intent that the remedies herein provided are in addition to, and not in lieu of, existing law. It is declared to be the public policy of this state that this chapter be construed and administered to the end that children shall be maintained from the resources of responsible parents, thereby relieving, at least in part, the burden presently borne by the general citizenry through welfare programs.</div>",

Each year approximately one million four hundred thousand people in this country, including children, sustain traumatic brain injuries as a result of a variety of causes including falls, motor vehicle injuries, being struck by an object, or as a result of an assault and other violent crimes, including domestic violence. Additionally, there are significant numbers of veterans who sustain traumatic brain injuries as a result of their service in the military.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">Prevention and the provision of appropriate supports and services in response to traumatic brain injury are consistent with the governor's executive order No. 10-01, \"Implementing Health Reform the Washington Way,\" which recognizes protection of public health and the improvement of health status as essential responsibilities of the public health system.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">Traumatic brain injury can cause a wide range of functional changes affecting thinking, sensation, language, or emotions. It can also cause epilepsy and increase the risk for conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and other brain disorders that become more prevalent with age. The impact of a traumatic brain injury on the individual and family can be devastating.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">The legislature recognizes that current programs and services are not funded or designed to address the diverse needs of this population.

The legislature recognizes, however, that nursing home care will continue to be a critical part of the state's long-term care options, and that such services should promote individual dignity, autonomy, and a homelike environment.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">The legislature finds that many recipients of in-home services are vulnerable and their health and well-being are dependent on their caregivers. The quality, skills, and knowledge of their caregivers are often the key to good care. The legislature finds that the need for well-trained caregivers is growing as the state's population ages and clients' needs increase. The legislature intends that current training standards be enhanced.</div>",

Beginning July 1, 2019, payments for these contracts must be based on the new methodology which must be phased-in to full implementation according to funding made available by the legislature for this purpose. The new payment system must have these components: Client care, operations, and room and board.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(2) Client care is the labor component of the system and must include variables to recognize the time and intensity of client care and services, staff wages, and associated fringe benefits. The wage variable in the client care component must be adjusted according to service areas based on labor costs.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(a) The time variable is used to weight the client care payment to client acuity and must be scaled according to the classification levels utilized in the department's assessment tool. The initial system shall establish a variable for time using the residential care time study conducted in 2001 and the department's corresponding estimate of the average staff hours per client by job position.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(b) The wage variable shall include recognition of staff positions needed to perform the functions required by contract, including nursing services. Data used to establish the wage variable must be adjusted so that no baseline wage is below the state minimum in effect at the time of implementation. The wage variable is a blended wage based on the federal bureau of labor statistics wage data and the distribution of time according to staff position. Blended wages are established for each county and then counties are arrayed from highest to lowest. Service areas are established and the median blended wage in each service area becomes the wage variable for all the assigned counties in that service area. The system must have no less than two service areas, one of which shall be a high labor cost service area and shall include counties at or above the ninety-fifth percentile in the array of blended wages.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(c) The fringe benefit variable recognizes employee benefits and payroll taxes. The factor to calculate the percentage of fringe benefits shall be established using the statewide nursing facility cost ratio of benefits and payroll taxes to in-house wages.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(3) The operations component must recognize costs that are allowable under federal medicaid rules for the federal matching percentage. The operations component is calculated at ninety percent or greater of the statewide median nursing facility costs associated with the following:</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(a) Supplies;</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(b) Nonlabor administrative expenses;</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(c) Staff education and in-service training; and</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(d) Operational overhead including licenses, insurance, and business and occupational [occupation] taxes.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(4) The room and board component recognizes costs that do not qualify for federal financial participation under medicaid rules by compensating providers for the medicaid client's share of raw food and shelter costs including expenses related to the physical plant such as property taxes, property and liability insurance, debt service, and major capital repairs. The room and board component is subject to the department's and the Washington state health care authority's rules related to client financial responsibility.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(5) Subsections (2) and (3) of this section establish the rate for medicaid covered services.

Beginning July 1, 2016, facilities must provide a minimum of 3.4 hours per resident day of direct care. Direct care staff has the same meaning as defined in RCW  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=74.42.010\">74.42.010</a>. The minimum staffing standard includes the time when such staff are providing hands-on care related to activities of daily living and nursing-related tasks, as well as care planning. The legislature intends to increase the minimum staffing standard to 4.1 hours per resident day of direct care, but the effective date of a standard higher than 3.4 hours per resident day of direct care will be identified if and only if funding is provided explicitly for an increase of the minimum staffing standard for direct care.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(a) The department shall establish in rule a system of compliance of minimum direct care staffing standards by January 1, 2016. Oversight must be done at least quarterly using the centers for medicare and medicaid services' payroll-based journal and nursing home facility census and payroll data.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(b) The department shall establish in rule by January 1, 2016, a system of financial penalties for facilities out of compliance with minimum staffing standards. No monetary penalty may be issued during the implementation period of July 1, 2016, through September 30, 2016. If a facility is found noncompliant during the implementation period, the department shall provide a written notice identifying the staffing deficiency and require the facility to provide a sufficiently detailed correction plan to meet the statutory minimum staffing levels. Monetary penalties begin October 1, 2016. Monetary penalties must be established based on a formula that calculates the cost of wages and benefits for the missing staff hours. If a facility meets the requirements in subsection (3) or (4) of this section, the penalty amount must be based solely on the wages and benefits of certified nurse aides. The first monetary penalty for noncompliance must be at a lower amount than subsequent findings of noncompliance. Monetary penalties established by the department may not exceed two hundred percent of the wage and benefit costs that would have otherwise been expended to achieve the required staffing minimum hours per resident day for the quarter. A facility found out of compliance must be assessed a monetary penalty at the lowest penalty level if the facility has met or exceeded the requirements in subsection (2) of this section for three or more consecutive years. Beginning July 1, 2016, pursuant to rules established by the department, funds that are received from financial penalties must be used for technical assistance, specialized training, or an increase to the quality enhancement established in RCW  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=74.46.561\">74.46.561</a>.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(c) The department shall establish in rule an exception allowing geriatric behavioral health workers as defined in RCW  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=74.42.010\">74.42.010</a> to be recognized in the minimum staffing requirements as part of the direct care service delivery to individuals who have a behavioral health condition. Hours worked by geriatric behavioral health workers may be recognized as direct care hours for purposes of the minimum staffing requirements only up to a portion of the total hours equal to the proportion of resident days of clients with a behavioral health condition identified at that facility on the most recent semiannual minimum data set. In order to qualify for the exception:</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(i) The worker must:</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(A) Have a bachelor's or master's degree in social work, behavioral health, or other related areas; or</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(B) Have at least three years experience providing care for individuals with chronic mental health issues, dementia, or intellectual and developmental disabilities in a long-term care or behavioral health care setting; or</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(C) Have successfully completed a facility-based behavioral health curriculum approved by the department under RCW  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=74.39A.078\">74.39A.078</a>;</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(ii) Any geriatric behavioral health worker holding less than a master's degree in social work must be directly supervised by an employee who has a master's degree in social work or a registered nurse.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(d)(i) The department shall establish a limited exception to the 3.4 hours per resident day staffing requirement for facilities demonstrating a good faith effort to hire and retain staff.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(ii) To determine initial facility eligibility for exception consideration, the department shall send surveys to facilities anticipated to be below, at, or slightly above the 3.4 hours per resident day requirement. These surveys must measure the hours per resident day in a manner as similar as possible to the centers for medicare and medicaid services' payroll-based journal and cover the staffing of a facility from October through December of 2015, January through March of 2016, and April through June of 2016. A facility must be below the 3.4 staffing standard on all three surveys to be eligible for exception consideration. If the staffing hours per resident day for a facility declines from any quarter to another during the survey period, the facility must provide sufficient information to the department to allow the department to determine if the staffing decrease was deliberate or a result of neglect, which is the lack of evidence demonstrating the facility's efforts to maintain or improve its staffing ratio. The burden of proof is on the facility and the determination of whether or not the decrease was deliberate or due to neglect is entirely at the discretion of the department. If the department determines a facility's decline was deliberate or due to neglect, that facility is not eligible for an exception consideration.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(iii) To determine eligibility for exception approval, the department shall review the plan of correction submitted by the facility. Before a facility's exception may be renewed, the department must determine that sufficient progress is being made towards reaching the 3.4 hours per resident day staffing requirement. When reviewing whether to grant or renew an exception, the department must consider factors including but not limited to: Financial incentives offered by the facilities such as recruitment bonuses and other incentives; the robustness of the recruitment process; county employment data; specific steps the facility has undertaken to improve retention; improvements in the staffing ratio compared to the baseline established in the surveys and whether this trend is continuing; and compliance with the process of submitting staffing data, adherence to the plan of correction, and any progress toward meeting this plan, as determined by the department.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(iv) Only facilities that have their direct care component rate increase capped according to RCW  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=74.46.561\">74.46.561</a> are eligible for exception consideration. Facilities that will have their direct care component rate increase capped for one or two years are eligible for exception consideration through June 30, 2017. Facilities that will have their direct care component rate increase capped for three years are eligible for exception consideration through June 30, 2018.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(v) The department may not grant or renew a facility's exception if the facility meets the 3.4 hours per resident day staffing requirement and subsequently drops below the 3.4 hours per resident day staffing requirement.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(vi) The department may grant exceptions for a six-month period per exception. The department's authority to grant exceptions to the 3.4 hours per resident day staffing requirement expires June 30, 2018.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(3)(a) Large nonessential community providers must have a registered nurse on duty directly supervising resident care twenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(b)(i) The department shall establish a limited exception process for large nonessential community providers that can demonstrate a good faith effort to hire a registered nurse for the last eight hours of required coverage per day. In granting an exception, the department may consider the competitiveness of the wages and benefits offered as compared to nursing facilities in comparable geographic or metropolitan areas within Washington state, the provider's recruitment and retention efforts, and the availability of registered nurses in the particular geographic area. A one-year exception may be granted and may be renewable; however, the department may limit the admission of new residents, based on medical conditions or complexities, when a registered nurse is not on-site and readily available. If a large nonessential community provider receives an exception, that information must be included in the department's nursing home locator.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(ii) By August 1, 2023, and every three years thereafter, the department, along with a stakeholder work group established by the department, shall conduct a review of the exceptions process to determine if it is still necessary. As part of this review, the department shall provide the legislature with a report that includes enforcement and citation data for large nonessential community providers that were granted an exception in the three previous fiscal years in comparison to those without an exception. The report must include a similar comparison of data, provided to the department by the long-term care ombuds, on long-term care ombuds referrals for large nonessential community providers that were granted an exception in the three previous fiscal years and those without an exception. This report, along with a recommendation as to whether the exceptions process should continue, is due to the legislature by December 1st of each year in which a review is conducted. Based on the recommendations outlined in this report, the legislature may take action to end the exceptions process.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(4) Essential community providers and small nonessential community providers must have a registered nurse on duty directly supervising resident care a minimum of sixteen hours per day, seven days per week, and a registered nurse or a licensed practical nurse on duty directly supervising resident care the remaining eight hours per day, seven days per week.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(5) For the purposes of this section, \"behavioral health condition\" means one or more of the behavioral symptoms specified in section E of the minimum data set.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(6) If a pandemic, natural disaster, or other declared state of emergency impedes or prevents facilities from compliance with subsections (2) through (4) of this section, the department may adopt rules to grant exceptions to these requirements, waive penalties, and suspend oversight activities. Facilities must remain in compliance with subsection (1) of this section. Rules adopted under this subsection are effective until 12 months after the termination of the pandemic, natural disaster, or other declared state of emergency or until determined no longer necessary by the department, whichever occurs first. Once the department determines a rule adopted under this subsection is no longer necessary, it must repeal the rule under RCW  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=34.05.353\">34.05.353</a>.</div>",

An equipment allowance of ten percent must be added to the unadjusted building value. The sum of the unadjusted building value and equipment allowance must then be reduced by the average age of the facility as determined by (e) of this subsection using a depreciation rate of one and one-half percent.

Beginning July 1, 2016, facility ages must be reduced in future years if the value of the renovation completed in any year exceeds two thousand dollars times the number of licensed beds. The cost of the renovation must be divided by the accumulated depreciation per bed in the year of the renovation to determine the equivalent number of new replacement beds. The new age for the facility is a weighted average with the replacement bed equivalents reflecting an age of zero and the existing licensed beds, minus the new bed equivalents, reflecting their age in the year of the renovation. At no time may the depreciated age be less than zero or greater than forty-four years.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(f) A nursing facility's capital component rate allocation must be rebased annually, effective July 1, 2016, in accordance with this section and this chapter.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(g) For the purposes of this subsection (5), \"RSMeans\" means building construction costs data as published by Gordian.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(6) A quality incentive must be offered as a rate enhancement beginning July 1, 2016.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(a) An enhancement no larger than five percent and no less than one percent of the statewide average daily rate must be paid to facilities that meet or exceed the standard established for the quality incentive.

For fiscal year 2017 there shall be four quality measures, and for fiscal year 2018 there shall be six quality measures. Initially, the quality incentive component must be based on minimum data set quality measures for the percentage of long-stay residents who self-report moderate to severe pain, the percentage of high-risk long-stay residents with pressure ulcers, the percentage of long-stay residents experiencing one or more falls with major injury, and the percentage of long-stay residents with a urinary tract infection. Quality measures must be reviewed on an annual basis by a stakeholder work group established by the department. Upon review, quality measures may be added or changed. The department may risk adjust individual quality measures as it deems appropriate.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(c) The facility quality score must be point based, using at a minimum the facility's most recent available three-quarter average centers for medicare and medicaid services quality data. Point thresholds for each quality measure must be established using the corresponding statistical values for the quality measure point determinants of eighty quality measure points, sixty quality measure points, forty quality measure points, and twenty quality measure points, identified in the most recent available five-star quality rating system technical user's guide published by the centers for medicare and medicaid services.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(d) Facilities meeting or exceeding the highest performance threshold (top level) for a quality measure receive twenty-five points. Facilities meeting the second highest performance threshold receive twenty points. Facilities meeting the third level of performance threshold receive fifteen points. Facilities in the bottom performance threshold level receive no points. Points from all quality measures must then be summed into a single aggregate quality score for each facility.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(e) Facilities receiving an aggregate quality score of eighty percent of the overall available total score or higher must be placed in the highest tier (tier V), facilities receiving an aggregate score of between seventy and seventy-nine percent of the overall available total score must be placed in the second highest tier (tier IV), facilities receiving an aggregate score of between sixty and sixty-nine percent of the overall available total score must be placed in the third highest tier (tier III), facilities receiving an aggregate score of between fifty and fifty-nine percent of the overall available total score must be placed in the fourth highest tier (tier II), and facilities receiving less than fifty percent of the overall available total score must be placed in the lowest tier (tier I).</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(f) The tier system must be used to determine the amount of each facility's per patient day quality incentive component. The per patient day quality incentive component for tier IV is seventy-five percent of the per patient day quality incentive component for tier V, the per patient day quality incentive component for tier III is fifty percent of the per patient day quality incentive component for tier V, and the per patient day quality incentive component for tier II is twenty-five percent of the per patient day quality incentive component for tier V. Facilities in tier I receive no quality incentive component.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(g) Tier system payments must be set in a manner that ensures that the entire biennial appropriation for the quality incentive program is allocated.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(h) Facilities with insufficient three-quarter average centers for medicare and medicaid services quality data must be assigned to the tier corresponding to their five-star quality rating. Facilities with a five-star quality rating must be assigned to the highest tier (tier V) and facilities with a one-star quality rating must be assigned to the lowest tier (tier I). The use of a facility's five-star quality rating shall only occur in the case of insufficient centers for medicare and medicaid services minimum data set information.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(i) The quality incentive rates must be adjusted semiannually on July 1 and January 1 of each year using, at a minimum, the most recent available three-quarter average centers for medicare and medicaid services quality data.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(j) Beginning July 1, 2017, the percentage of short-stay residents who newly received an antipsychotic medication must be added as a quality measure. The department must determine the quality incentive thresholds for this quality measure in a manner consistent with those outlined in (b) through (h) of this subsection using the centers for medicare and medicaid services quality data.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(k) Beginning July 1, 2017, the percentage of direct care staff turnover must be added as a quality measure using the centers for medicare and medicaid services' payroll-based journal and nursing home facility payroll data. Turnover is defined as an employee departure. The department must determine the quality incentive thresholds for this quality measure using data from the centers for medicare and medicaid services' payroll-based journal, unless such data is not available, in which case the department shall use direct care staffing turnover data from the most recent medicaid cost report.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(7) Reimbursement of the safety net assessment imposed by chapter  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=74.48\">74.48</a> RCW and paid in relation to medicaid residents must be continued.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(8)(a) The direct care and indirect care components must be rebased in even-numbered years, beginning with rates paid on July 1, 2016. Rates paid on July 1, 2016, must be based on the 2014 calendar year cost report. On a percentage basis, after rebasing, the department must confirm that the statewide average daily rate has increased at least as much as the average rate of inflation, as determined by the skilled nursing facility market basket index published by the centers for medicare and medicaid services, or a comparable index. If after rebasing, the percentage increase to the statewide average daily rate is less than the average rate of inflation for the same time period, the department is authorized to increase rates by the difference between the percentage increase after rebasing and the average rate of inflation.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(b) It is the intention of the legislature that direct and indirect care rates paid in fiscal year 2022 will be rebased using the calendar year 2019 cost reports. For fiscal year 2021, in addition to the rates generated by (a) of this subsection, an additional adjustment is provided as established in this subsection (8)(b). Beginning May 1, 2020, and through June 30, 2021, the calendar year costs must be adjusted for inflation by a twenty-four month consumer price index, based on the most recently available monthly index for all urban consumers, as published by the bureau of labor statistics. It is also the intent of the legislature that, starting in fiscal year 2022, a facility-specific rate add-on equal to the inflation adjustment that facilities received solely in fiscal year 2021, must be added to the rate. For fiscal year 2024, the direct care and indirect care components shall be rebased to the 2021 calendar year cost report plus a 4.7 percent adjustment for inflation. For fiscal year 2025, the direct and indirect care components shall be rebased to the 2022 calendar year cost report plus a five percent adjustment for inflation.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(c) To determine the necessity of regular inflationary adjustments to the nursing facility rates, by December 1, 2020, the department shall provide the appropriate policy and fiscal committees of the legislature with a report that provides a review of rates paid in 2017, 2018, and 2019 in comparison to costs incurred by nursing facilities.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(9) The direct care component provided in subsection (3) of this section is subject to the reconciliation and settlement process provided in RCW  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=74.46.022\">74.46.022</a>(6).

Failure to meet these federal program integrity standards could jeopardize the federal funding for Washington's medicaid program.
