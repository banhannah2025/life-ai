wildlife is authorized to enter into such compact on behalf of the state with all other jurisdictions legally joining therein:</div><div style=\"text-align:center;margin-top:4.5pt;\">ARTICLE I</div><div style=\"text-align:center;\">FINDINGS, DECLARATION OF</div><div style=\"text-align:center;\">POLICY, AND PURPOSE</div><div style=\"margin-top:4.5pt;text-indent:0.5in;\">(a) The party states find that:</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(1) Wildlife resources are managed in trust by the respective states for the benefit of all residents and visitors.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(2) The protection of their respective wildlife resources can be materially affected by the degree of compliance with state statute, law, regulation, ordinance, or administrative rule relating to the management of those resources.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(3) The preservation, protection, management, and restoration of wildlife contributes immeasurably to the aesthetic, recreational, and economic aspects of these natural resources.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(4) Wildlife resources are valuable without regard to political boundaries, therefore, all persons should be required to comply with wildlife preservation, protection, management, and restoration laws, ordinances, and administrative rules and regulations of all party states as a condition precedent to the continuance or issuance of any license to hunt, fish, trap, or possess wildlife.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(5) Violation of wildlife laws interferes with the management of wildlife resources and may endanger the safety of persons and property.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(6) The mobility of many wildlife law violators necessitates the maintenance of channels of communications among the various states.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(7) In most instances, a person who is cited for a wildlife violation in a state other than the person's home state:</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(i) Must post collateral or bond to secure appearance for a trial at a later date; or</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(ii) If unable to post collateral or bond, is taken into custody until the collateral or bond is posted; or</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(iii) Is taken directly to court for an immediate appearance.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(8) The purpose of the enforcement practices described in paragraph (7) of this subdivision is to ensure compliance with the terms of a wildlife citation by the person who, if permitted to continue on the person's way after receiving the citation, could return to the person's home state and disregard the person's duty under the terms of the citation.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(9) In most instances, a person receiving a wildlife citation in the person's home state is permitted to accept the citation from the officer at the scene of the violation and to immediately continue on the person's way after agreeing or being instructed to comply with the terms of the citation.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(10) The practice described in paragraph (7) of this subdivision causes unnecessary inconvenience and, at times, a hardship for the person who is unable at the time to post collateral, furnish a bond, stand trial, or pay the fine, and thus is compelled to remain in custody until some alternative arrangement can be made.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(11) The enforcement practices described in paragraph (7) of this subdivision consume an undue amount of law enforcement time.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(b) It is the policy of the party states to:</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(1) Promote compliance with the statutes, laws, ordinances, regulations, and administrative rules relating to management of wildlife resources in their respective states.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(2) Recognize the suspension of wildlife license privileges of any person whose license privileges have been suspended by a party state and treat this suspension as if it had occurred in their state.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(3) Allow violators to accept a wildlife citation, except as provided in subdivision (b) of Article III, and proceed on the violator's way without delay whether or not the person is a resident in the state in which the citation was issued, provided that the violator's home state is party to this compact.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(4) Report to the appropriate party state, as provided in the compact manual, any conviction recorded against any person whose home state was not the issuing state.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(5) Allow the home state to recognize and treat convictions recorded for their residents which occurred in another party state as if they had occurred in the home state.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(6) Extend cooperation to its fullest extent among the party states for obtaining compliance with the terms of a wildlife citation issued in one party state to a resident of another party state.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(7) Maximize effective use of law enforcement personnel and information.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(8) Assist court systems in the efficient disposition of wildlife violations.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(c) The purpose of this compact is to:</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(1) Provide a means through which the party states may participate in a reciprocal program to effectuate policies enumerated in subdivision (b) of this article in a uniform and orderly manner.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(2) Provide for the fair and impartial treatment of wildlife violators operating within party states in recognition of the person's right of due process and the sovereign status of a party state.</div><div style=\"text-align:center;margin-top:4.5pt;\">ARTICLE II</div><div style=\"text-align:center;\">DEFINITIONS</div><div

The legislature also finds that a statewide salmon recovery strategy must be developed and implemented through an active public involvement process in order to ensure public participation in, and support for, salmon recovery. The legislature also finds that there is a substantial link between the provisions of the federal endangered species act and the federal clean water act (33 U.S.C. Sec. 1251 et seq.).

Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to specifically address salmon habitat restoration in a coordinated manner and to develop a structure that allows for the coordinated delivery of federal, state, and local assistance to communities for habitat projects that will assist in the recovery and enhancement of salmon stocks. A strong watershed-based locally implemented plan is essential for local, regional, and statewide salmon recovery.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">The legislature also finds that credible scientific review and oversight is essential for any salmon recovery effort to be successful.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">The legislature further finds that it is important to monitor the overall health of the salmon resource to determine if recovery efforts are providing expected returns. It is important to monitor salmon habitat projects and salmon recovery activities to determine their effectiveness in order to secure federal acceptance of the state's approach to salmon recovery. Adaptive management cannot exist without monitoring. For these reasons, the legislature believes that a coordinated and integrated monitoring system should be developed and implemented.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">The legislature therefore finds that a coordinated framework for responding to the salmon crisis is needed immediately. To that end, the governor's salmon recovery office should be created to provide overall coordination of the state's response; an independent science panel is needed to provide scientific review and oversight; a coordinated state funding process should be established through a salmon recovery funding board; the appropriate local or tribal government should provide local leadership in identifying and sequencing habitat projects to be funded by state agencies; habitat projects should be implemented without delay; and a strong locally based effort to restore salmon habitat should be established by providing a framework to allow citizen volunteers to work effectively.</div>",

The legislature further finds that the forestry industry, small landowners, tribal governments, state and federal agencies, and counties have worked diligently for nearly two years to reach agreement on scientifically based changes to the forest practices rules, set forth in the forests and fish report as defined in RCW  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=76.09.020\">76.09.020</a>. The legislature further finds that if existing forest practices rules are amended as proposed in the forests and fish report as defined in RCW  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=76.09.020\">76.09.020</a>, the resulting changes in forest practices (a) will lead to: (i) Salmon habitat that meets riparian functions vital to the long-term recovery of salmon on more than sixty thousand miles of streams in this state; (ii) identification of forest roads contributing to habitat degradation and corrective action to remedy those problems to protect salmon habitat; (iii) increased protection of steep and unstable slopes; and (iv) the implementation of scientifically based adaptive management and monitoring processes for evaluating the impacts of forest practices on aquatic resources, as defined in RCW  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=76.09.020\">76.09.020</a>, and a process for amending the forest practices rules to incorporate new information as it becomes available; (b) will lead to the protection of aquatic resources to the maximum extent practicable consistent with maintaining commercial forest management as an economically viable use of lands suitable for that purpose; and (c) will provide a regulatory climate and structure more likely to keep landowners from converting forestlands to other uses that would be less desirable for salmon recovery.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(2) The legislature further finds that the changes in laws and rules contemplated by chapter 4, Laws of 1999 sp. sess., taken as a whole, constitute a comprehensive and coordinated program to provide substantial and sufficient contributions to salmon recovery and water quality enhancement in areas impacted by forest practices and are intended to fully satisfy the requirements of the endangered species act (16 U.S.C. Sec. 1531 et seq.) with respect to incidental take of salmon and other aquatic resources and the clean water act (33 U.S.C. Sec. 1251 et seq.) with respect to nonpoint source pollution attributable to forest practices.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(3) The legislature finds that coordination is needed between the laws relating to forestry in chapter  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=76.09\">76.09</a> RCW and the state salmon recovery strategy being developed under this chapter. The coordination should ensure that nonfederal forestlands are managed in ways that make appropriate contributions to the recovery of salmonid fish, water quality, and related environmental amenities while encouraging continued investments in those lands for commercial forestry purposes. Specifically, the legislature finds that forest practices rules relating to water quality, salmon, certain other species of fish, certain species of stream-associated amphibians, and their respective habitats should be coordinated with the rules and policies relating to other land uses through the statewide salmon recovery planning process. The legislature further finds that this subchapter is but one part of a comprehensive salmon strategy as required in this chapter, and this investment in salmon habitat will be of little value if a comprehensive state plan is not completed and fully implemented.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(4) The legislature recognizes that the adoption of forest practices rules consistent with the forests and fish report as defined in RCW  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=76.09.020\">76.09.020</a> will impose substantial financial burdens on forestland owners which, if not partially offset through other changes in the laws and rules governing forestry, could lead to significantly reduced silvicultural investments on nonfederal lands, deterioration in the quality, condition, and amounts of forests on those lands, and long-term adverse effects on fish and wildlife habitat and other environmental amenities associated with well managed forests. Moreover, as the benefits of the proposed revisions to the forest practices rules will benefit the general public, chapter 4, Laws of 1999 sp. sess. suggests that some of these costs be shared with the general public.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(5) As an integral part of implementing the salmon recovery strategy, chapter 4, Laws of 1999 sp. sess. (a) provides direction to the forest practices board, the department of natural resources, and the department of ecology with respect to the adoption, implementation, and enforcement of rules relating to forest practices and the protection of aquatic resources; (b) provides additional enforcement tools to the department of natural resources to enforce the forest practices rules; (c) anticipates the need for adequate and consistent funding for the various programmatic elements necessary to fully implement the strategy over time and derive the long-term benefits; (d) provides for the acquisition by the state of forestlands within certain stream channel migration zones where timber harvest will not be allowed; (e) provides for small landowners to have costs shared for a portion of any extraordinary economic losses attributable to the revisions to the forest practices rules required by chapter 4, Laws of 1999 sp. sess.; and (f) amends other existing laws to aid in the implementation of the recommendations set forth in the forests and fish report as defined in RCW  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=76.09.020\">76.09.020</a>.</div>",
