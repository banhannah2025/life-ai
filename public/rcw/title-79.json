However, the timber and other products on the land may be sold, or the land may be leased in the same manner and for the same purposes as authorized for state granted lands if the department finds the sale or lease to be in the best interest of this forest reserve land base and approves the terms and conditions of the sale or lease.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(3) The land exchange and acquisition powers provided in RCW  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=79.17.020\">79.17.020</a> may be used by the department to reposition land within the community and technical college forest reserve land base consistent with subsection (1) of this section.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(4) By June 30, 2019, the department must exchange land within the community and technical college forest reserve for land of equal value held for the benefit of charitable, educational, penal, and reformatory institutions that is currently leased to certain community and technical colleges under section 1, chapter 168, Laws of 1985 and section 1, chapter 198, Laws of 2004.

Stocks of salmon on the Columbia and Snake rivers have been listed under the federal endangered species act, and the bull trout has been petitioned for listing. Some scientists believe that numerous other stocks of salmonids in the Pacific Northwest are in decline or possibly extinct. The legislature declares that to lose wild stocks is detrimental to the genetic diversity of the fisheries resource and the economy, and will represent the loss of a vital component of Washington's aquatic ecosystems. The legislature further finds that there is a continuing loss of habitat for fish and wildlife. The legislature declares that steps must be taken in the areas of wildlife and fish habitat management, water conservation, wild salmonid stock protection, and education to prevent further losses of Washington's fish and wildlife heritage from a number of causes including urban and rural subdivisions, shopping centers, industrial park, and other land use activities.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">The legislature finds that the maintenance and restoration of Washington's rangelands and shrub-steppe vegetation is vital to the long-term benefit of the people of the state.

As a consequence of this lack of technical assistance, our state grazing lands, including fish and wildlife habitat and other resources provided by these lands, are not achieving their potential.
