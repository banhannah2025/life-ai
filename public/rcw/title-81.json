They further recognize that it is not economically feasible for the commercial airlines to provide a full complement of short-haul air services or to explore fully the capabilities and limitations of the various types and locations of such services. They also recognize that careful planning, experimentation, and testing are needed before appropriate short-haul air transportation can be developed for all the situations in which it would be beneficial to the economy and general welfare of the western states. To meet this need, the party states agree that a regional compact should be established for the purpose of organizing and conducting a series of demonstration programs to test the feasibility of new short-haul air transportation concepts in the West.</div><div style=\"text-align:center;margin-top:4.5pt;\">Article II</div><div style=\"text-align:center;\">REGIONAL COMMISSION</div><div style=\"margin-top:4.5pt;text-indent:0.5in;\">A.

The federal member shall not be entitled to a vote on the Commission unless authorized by a majority vote of the state members. The state members may provide that decisions of the Commission shall require the affirmative vote of the federal member and of a majority of the state members, if such provision is necessary in order to meet the requirements of federal law. In matters coming before the Commission, the state members shall, to the extent practicable, consult with representatives of appropriate local subdivisions within their respective states and the federal member, if any, shall consult with the federal departments and agencies having an interest in the subject matter.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">D. The state members of the Commission shall elect annually, from among their number, a chairman and a vice chairman.

          "bodyHtml": "<div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">State and national policy directs that the management of low-level radioactive waste be accomplished by a system of interstate compacts and the development of regional disposal sites. The Northwest regional compact, comprised of the states of Alaska, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Utah, and Washington, has as its disposal facility the low-level radioactive waste disposal site located near Richland, Washington. This site is expected to be the sole site for disposal of low-level radioactive waste for compact members effective January 1, 1993. Future closure of this site will require significant financial resources.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">Low-level radioactive waste is generated by essential activities and services that benefit the citizens of the state. Washington state's low-level radioactive waste disposal site has been used by the nation and the Northwest compact as a disposal site since 1965. The public has come to rely on access to this site for disposal of low-level radioactive waste, which requires separate handling from other solid and hazardous wastes. The price of disposing of low-level radioactive waste at the Washington state low-level radioactive waste disposal site is anticipated to increase when the federal low-level radioactive waste policy amendments act of 1985 is implemented and waste generated outside the Northwest compact states is excluded.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">When these events occur, to protect Washington and other Northwest compact states' businesses and services, such as electrical production, medical and university research, and private industries, upon which the public relies, there will be a need to regulate the rates charged by the operator of Washington's low-level radioactive waste disposal site. This chapter is adopted pursuant to section 8, chapter 21, Laws of 1990.</div>",

As the single agency's services are established, any public transportation services currently provided that are duplicative should be eliminated. Further, the single agency must coordinate its activities with other agencies providing local and state roadway services, implementing comprehensive planning, and implementing transportation demand management programs and assist in developing infrastructure to support high capacity systems including but not limited to feeder systems, park and ride facilities, intermodal centers, and related roadway and operational facilities.
