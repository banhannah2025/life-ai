This rate must be published in the state register by the department not later than January 1st of each year for use in that assessment year.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(3) \"Composite property tax rate\" for a county means the total amount of property taxes levied upon forestlands by all taxing districts in the county other than the state, divided by the total assessed value of all forestland in the county.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(4) \"Contiguous\" means land adjoining and touching other property held by the same ownership. Land divided by a public road, but otherwise an integral part of a timber growing and harvesting operation, is considered contiguous. Solely for the purposes of this subsection (4), \"same ownership\" has the same meaning as in RCW  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=84.34.020\">84.34.020</a>(6).</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(5) \"Forestland\" is synonymous with \"designated forestland\" and means any parcel of land that is five or more acres or multiple parcels of land that are contiguous and total five or more acres that is or are devoted primarily to growing and harvesting timber. Designated forestland means the land only and does not include a residential homesite. The term includes land used for incidental uses that are compatible with the growing and harvesting of timber but no more than ten percent of the land may be used for such incidental uses. It also includes the land on which appurtenances necessary for the production, preparation, or sale of the timber products exist in conjunction with land producing these products.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(6) \"Harvested\" means the time when in the ordinary course of business the quantity of timber by species is first definitely determined. The amount harvested must be determined by the Scribner Decimal C Scale or other prevalent measuring practice adjusted to arrive at substantially equivalent measurements, as approved by the department.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(7) \"Harvester\" means every person who from the person's own land or from the land of another under a right or license granted by lease or contract, either directly or by contracting with others for the necessary labor or mechanical services, fells, cuts, or takes timber for sale or for commercial or industrial use. When the United States or any instrumentality thereof, the state, including its departments and institutions and political subdivisions, or any municipal corporation therein so fells, cuts, or takes timber for sale or for commercial or industrial use, the harvester is the first person other than the United States or any instrumentality thereof, the state, including its departments and institutions and political subdivisions, or any municipal corporation therein, who acquires title to or a possessory interest in the timber. The term \"harvester\" does not include persons performing under contract the necessary labor or mechanical services for a harvester.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(8) \"Harvesting and marketing costs\" means only those costs directly associated with harvesting the timber from the land and delivering it to the buyer and may include the costs of disposing of logging residues. Any other costs that are not directly and exclusively related to harvesting and marketing of the timber, such as costs of permanent roads or costs of reforesting the land following harvest, are not harvesting and marketing costs.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(9) \"Incidental use\" means a use of designated forestland that is compatible with its purpose for growing and harvesting timber. An incidental use may include a gravel pit, a shed or land used to store machinery or equipment used in conjunction with the timber enterprise, and any other use that does not interfere with or indicate that the forestland is no longer primarily being used to grow and harvest timber.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(10) \"Local government\" means any city, town, county, water-sewer district, public utility district, port district, irrigation district, flood control district, or any other municipal corporation, quasi-municipal corporation, or other political subdivision authorized to levy special benefit assessments for sanitary or storm sewerage systems, domestic water supply or distribution systems, or road construction or improvement purposes.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(11) \"Local improvement district\" means any local improvement district, utility local improvement district, local utility district, road improvement district, or any similar unit created by a local government for the purpose of levying special benefit assessments against property specially benefited by improvements relating to the districts.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(12) \"Owner\" means the party or parties having the fee interest in land, except where land is subject to a real estate contract \"owner\" means the contract vendee.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(13) \"Primarily\" or \"primary use\" means the existing use of the land is so prevalent that when the characteristic use of the land is evaluated any other use appears to be conflicting or nonrelated.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(14) \"Short-rotation hardwoods\" means hardwood trees, such as but not limited to hybrid cottonwoods, cultivated by agricultural methods in growing cycles shorter than fifteen years.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(15) \"Small harvester\" means every person who from his or her own land or from the land of another under a right or license granted by lease or contract, either directly or by contracting with others for the necessary labor or mechanical services, fells, cuts, or takes timber for sale or for commercial or industrial use in an amount not exceeding two million board feet in a calendar year. When the United States or any instrumentality thereof, the state, including its departments and institutions and political subdivisions, or any municipal corporation therein so fells, cuts, or takes timber for sale or for commercial or industrial use, not exceeding these amounts, the small harvester is the first person other than the United States or any instrumentality thereof, the state, including its departments and institutions and political subdivisions, or any municipal corporation therein, who acquires title to or a possessory interest in the timber. Small harvester does not include persons performing under contract the necessary labor or mechanical services for a harvester, and it does not include the harvesters of Christmas trees or short-rotation hardwoods.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(16) \"Special benefit assessments\" means special assessments levied or capable of being levied in any local improvement district or otherwise levied or capable of being levied by a local government to pay for all or part of the costs of a local improvement and which may be levied only for the special benefits to be realized by property by reason of that local improvement.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(17) \"Stumpage value of timber\" means the appropriate stumpage value shown on tables prepared by the department under RCW  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=84.33.091\">84.33.091</a>. However, for timber harvested from public land and sold under a competitive bidding process, stumpage value means the actual amount paid to the seller in cash or other consideration. The stumpage value of timber from public land does not include harvesting and marketing costs if the timber from public land is harvested by, or under contract for, the United States or any instrumentality of the United States, the state, including its departments and institutions and political subdivisions, or any municipal corporation therein. Whenever payment for the stumpage includes considerations other than cash, the value is the fair market value of the other consideration. If the other consideration is permanent roads, the value of the roads must be the appraised value as appraised by the seller.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(18) \"Timber\" means forest trees, standing or down, on privately or publicly owned land, and except as provided in RCW  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=84.33.170\">84.33.170</a> includes Christmas trees and short-rotation hardwoods.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(19) \"Timber assessed value\" for a county means the sum of: (a) The total stumpage value of timber harvested from publicly owned land in the county multiplied by the public timber ratio, plus; (b) the total stumpage value of timber harvested from privately owned land in the county multiplied by the private timber ratio. The numerator of the public timber ratio is the rate of tax imposed by the county under RCW  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=84.33.051\">84.33.051</a> on public timber harvests for the year of the calculation. The numerator of the private timber ratio is the rate of tax imposed by the county under RCW  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=84.33.051\">84.33.051</a> on private timber harvests for the year of the calculation. The denominator of the private timber ratio and the public timber ratio is the composite property tax rate for the county for taxes due in the year of the calculation, expressed as a percentage of assessed value. The department must use the stumpage value of timber harvested during the most recent four calendar quarters for which the information is available. The department must calculate the timber assessed value for each county before October 1st of each year.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(20) \"Timber assessed value\" for a taxing district means the timber assessed value for the county multiplied by a ratio. The numerator of the ratio is the total assessed value of forestland in the taxing district. The denominator is the total assessed value of forestland in the county. As used in this section, \"assessed value of forestland\" means the assessed value of forestland for taxes due in the year the timber assessed value for the county is calculated plus an additional value for public forestland. The additional value for public forestland is the product of the number of acres of public forestland that are available for timber harvesting determined under RCW  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=84.33.089\">84.33.089</a> and the average assessed value per acre of private forestland in the county.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(21) \"Timber management plan\" means a plan prepared by a trained forester, or any other person with adequate knowledge of timber management practices, concerning the use of the land to grow and harvest timber. Such a plan may include:</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(a) A legal description of the forestland;</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(b) A statement that the forestland is held in contiguous ownership of five or more acres and is primarily devoted to and used to grow and harvest timber;</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(c) A brief description of the timber on the forestland or, if the timber on the land has been harvested, the owner's plan to restock the land with timber;</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(d) A statement about whether the forestland is also used to graze livestock;</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(e) A statement about whether the land has been used in compliance with the restocking, forest management, fire protection, insect and disease control, and forest debris provisions of Title <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=76\">76</a> RCW; and</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(f) If the land has been recently harvested or supports a growth of brush and noncommercial type timber, a description of the owner's plan to restock the forestland within three years.</div>",

For the adjustment to be made on or before December 31, 2001, for use in the 2002 assessment year, the department must:</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(a) Divide the aggregate value of all timber harvested within the state between July 1, 1996, and June 30, 2001, by the aggregate harvest volume for the same period, as determined from the harvester excise tax returns filed with the department under RCW  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=84.33.074\">84.33.074</a>; and</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(b) Divide the aggregate value of all timber harvested within the state between July 1, 1995, and June 30, 2000, by the aggregate harvest volume for the same period, as determined from the harvester excise tax returns filed with the department under RCW  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=84.33.074\">84.33.074</a>; and</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(c) Adjust the forestland values contained in subsection (2) of this section by a percentage equal to one-half of the percentage change in the average values of harvested timber reflected by comparing the resultant values calculated under (a) and (b) of this subsection.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(4) For the adjustments to be made on or before December 31, 2002, and each succeeding year thereafter, the same procedure described in subsection (3) of this section must be followed using harvester excise tax returns filed under RCW  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=84.33.074\">84.33.074</a>. However, this adjustment must be made to the prior year's adjusted value, and the five-year periods for calculating average harvested timber values must be successively one year more recent.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(5) Land graded, assessed, and valued as forestland must continue to be so graded, assessed, and valued until removal of designation by the assessor upon the occurrence of any of the following:</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(a) Receipt of notice of request to withdraw land classified under RCW  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=84.34.020\">84.34.020</a>(3) within two years before the date of the merger under RCW  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=84.34.400\">84.34.400</a>. Land previously classified under chapter  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=84.34\">84.34</a> RCW will be removed under the provisions of this chapter when two assessment years have passed following receipt of the notice as described in RCW  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=84.34.070\">84.34.070</a>(1);</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(b) Receipt of notice from the owner to remove the designation;</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(c) Sale or transfer to an ownership making the land exempt from ad valorem taxation;</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(d) Sale or transfer of all or a portion of the land to a new owner, unless the new owner has signed a notice of forestland designation continuance, except transfer to an owner who is an heir or devisee of a deceased owner or transfer by a transfer on death deed, does not, by itself, result in removal of designation. The signed notice of continuance must be attached to the real estate excise tax affidavit provided for in RCW  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=82.45.150\">82.45.150</a>. The notice of continuance must be on a form prepared by the department. If the notice of continuance is not signed by the new owner and attached to the real estate excise tax affidavit, all compensating taxes calculated under subsection (11) of this section are due and payable by the seller or transferor at time of sale. The auditor may not accept an instrument of conveyance regarding designated forestland for filing or recording unless the new owner has signed the notice of continuance or the compensating tax has been paid, as evidenced by the real estate excise tax stamp affixed thereto by the treasurer. The seller, transferor, or new owner may appeal the new assessed valuation calculated under subsection (11) of this section to the county board of equalization in accordance with the provisions of RCW  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=84.40.038\">84.40.038</a>. Jurisdiction is hereby conferred on the county board of equalization to hear these appeals;</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(e) Determination by the assessor, after giving the owner written notice and an opportunity to be heard, that:</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(i) The land is no longer primarily devoted to and used for growing and harvesting timber. However, land may not be removed from designation if a governmental agency, organization, or other recipient identified in subsection (13) or (14) of this section as exempt from the payment of compensating tax has manifested its intent in writing or by other official action to acquire a property interest in the designated forestland by means of a transaction that qualifies for an exemption under subsection (13) or (14) of this section. The governmental agency, organization, or recipient must annually provide the assessor of the county in which the land is located reasonable evidence in writing of the intent to acquire the designated land as long as the intent continues or within sixty days of a request by the assessor. The assessor may not request this evidence more than once in a calendar year;</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(ii) The owner has failed to comply with a final administrative or judicial order with respect to a violation of the restocking, forest management, fire protection, insect and disease control, and forest debris provisions of Title <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=76\">76</a> RCW or any applicable rules under Title <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=76\">76</a> RCW; or</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(iii) Restocking has not occurred to the extent or within the time specified in the application for designation of such land.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(6) Land may not be removed from designation if there is a governmental restriction that prohibits, in whole or in part, the owner from harvesting timber from the owner's designated forestland. If only a portion of the parcel is impacted by governmental restrictions of this nature, the restrictions cannot be used as a basis to remove the remainder of the forestland from designation under this chapter. For the purposes of this section, \"governmental restrictions\" includes: (a) Any law, regulation, rule, ordinance, program, or other action adopted or taken by a federal, state, county, city, or other governmental entity; or (b) the land's zoning or its presence within an urban growth area designated under RCW  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=36.70A.110\">36.70A.110</a>.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(7) The assessor has the option of requiring an owner of forestland to file a timber management plan with the assessor upon the occurrence of one of the following:</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(a) An application for designation as forestland is submitted;</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(b) Designated forestland is sold or transferred and a notice of continuance, described in subsection (5)(d) of this section, is signed; or</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(c) The assessor has reason to believe that forestland sized less than twenty acres is no longer primarily devoted to and used for growing and harvesting timber. The assessor may require a timber management plan to assist with determining continuing eligibility as designated forestland.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(8) If land is removed from designation because of any of the circumstances listed in subsection (5)(a) through (d) of this section, the removal applies only to the land affected. If land is removed from designation because of subsection (5)(e) of this section, the removal applies only to the actual area of land that is no longer primarily devoted to the growing and harvesting of timber, without regard to any other land that may have been included in the application and approved for designation, as long as the remaining designated forestland meets the definition of forestland contained in RCW  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=84.33.035\">84.33.035</a>.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(9) Within thirty days after the removal of designation as forestland, the assessor must notify the owner in writing, setting forth the reasons for the removal. The seller, transferor, or owner may appeal the removal to the county board of equalization in accordance with the provisions of RCW  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=84.40.038\">84.40.038</a>.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(10) Unless the removal is reversed on appeal a copy of the notice of removal with a notation of the action, if any, upon appeal, together with the legal description or assessor's parcel numbers for the land removed from designation must, at the expense of the applicant, be filed by the assessor in the same manner as deeds are recorded and a notation of removal from designation must immediately be made upon the assessment and tax rolls. The assessor must revalue the land to be removed with reference to its true and fair value as of January 1st of the year of removal from designation. Both the assessed value before and after the removal of designation must be listed. Taxes based on the value of the land as forestland are assessed and payable up until the date of removal and taxes based on the true and fair value of the land are assessed and payable from the date of removal from designation.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(11) Except as provided otherwise in this section, a compensating tax is imposed on land removed from designation as forestland. The compensating tax is due and payable to the treasurer thirty days after the owner is notified of the amount of this tax. As soon as possible after the land is removed from designation, the assessor must compute the amount of compensating tax, and the treasurer must mail a notice to the owner of the amount of compensating tax owed and the date on which payment of this tax is due. The amount of compensating tax is equal to the difference between the amount of tax last levied on the land as designated forestland and an amount equal to the new assessed value of the land multiplied by the dollar rate of the last levy extended against the land, multiplied by a number, in no event greater than nine, equal to the number of years for which the land was designated as forestland, plus compensating taxes on the land at forestland values up until the date of removal and the prorated taxes on the land at true and fair value from the date of removal to the end of the current tax year.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(12) Compensating tax, together with applicable interest thereon, becomes a lien on the land, which attaches at the time the land is removed from designation as forestland and has priority and must be fully paid and satisfied before any recognizance, mortgage, judgment, debt, obligation, or responsibility to or with which the land may become charged or liable. The lien may be foreclosed upon expiration of the same period after delinquency and in the same manner provided by law for foreclosure of liens for delinquent real property taxes as provided in RCW  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=84.64.050\">84.64.050</a>. Any compensating tax unpaid on its due date will thereupon become delinquent. From the date of delinquency until paid, interest is charged at the same rate applied by law to delinquent ad valorem property taxes.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(13) The compensating tax specified in subsection (11) of this section may not be imposed if the removal of designation under subsection (5) of this section resulted solely from:</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(a) Transfer to a government entity in exchange for other forestland located within the state of Washington;</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(b)(i) A taking through the exercise of the power of eminent domain, or (ii) a sale or transfer to an entity having the power of eminent domain in anticipation of the exercise of such power based on official action taken by the entity and confirmed in writing;</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(c) A donation of fee title, development rights, or the right to harvest timber, to a government agency or organization qualified under RCW  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=84.34.210\">84.34.210</a> and  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=64.04.130\">64.04.130</a> for the purposes enumerated in those sections, or the sale or transfer of fee title to a governmental entity or a nonprofit nature conservancy corporation, as defined in RCW  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=64.04.130\">64.04.130</a>, exclusively for the protection and conservation of lands recommended for state natural area preserve purposes by the natural heritage council and natural heritage plan as defined in chapter  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=79.70\">79.70</a> RCW or approved for state natural resources conservation area purposes as defined in chapter  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=79.71\">79.71</a> RCW, or for acquisition and management as a community forest trust as defined in chapter  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=79.155\">79.155</a> RCW. At such time as the land is not used for the purposes enumerated, the compensating tax specified in subsection (11) of this section is imposed upon the current owner;</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(d) The sale or transfer of fee title to the parks and recreation commission for park and recreation purposes;</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(e) Official action by an agency of the state of Washington or by the county or city within which the land is located that disallows the present use of the land;</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(f) The creation, sale, or transfer of forestry riparian easements under RCW  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=76.13.120\">76.13.120</a>;</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(g) The creation, sale, or transfer of a conservation easement of private forestlands within unconfined channel migration zones or containing critical habitat for threatened or endangered species under RCW  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=76.09.040\">76.09.040</a>;</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(h) The sale or transfer of land within two years after the death of the owner of at least a fifty percent interest in the land if the land has been assessed and valued as classified forestland, designated as forestland under this chapter, or classified under chapter  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=84.34\">84.34</a> RCW continuously since 1993. The date of death shown on a death certificate is the date used for the purposes of this subsection (13)(h);</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(i)(i) The discovery that the land was designated under this chapter in error through no fault of the owner. For purposes of this subsection (13)(i), \"fault\" means a knowingly false or misleading statement, or other act or omission not in good faith, that contributed to the approval of designation under this chapter or the failure of the assessor to remove the land from designation under this chapter.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(ii) For purposes of this subsection (13), the discovery that land was designated under this chapter in error through no fault of the owner is not the sole reason for removal of designation under subsection (5) of this section if an independent basis for removal exists. An example of an independent basis for removal includes the land no longer being devoted to and used for growing and harvesting timber; or</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(j) The sale or transfer to a governmental entity if the governmental entity manages the land in the same manner as designated forestland under this chapter or property classified as timberland under chapter  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=84.34\">84.34</a> RCW, and the governmental entity provides the county assessor with a timber management plan or a notice of intent to manage the land as required under this subsection (13)(j). The governmental entity must provide an updated timberland or forestland management plan to the county assessor at least once every revaluation cycle. The county is authorized to collect a fee from the governmental entity for the filing of the forestland or timberland management plan in accordance with the county's fee schedule. When the land is not managed as required under this subsection (13)(j), or when the governmental entity sells or transfers the land at any time, the compensating tax specified in subsection (11) of this section is due from the current government owner, unless the change in use of the land, sale or transfer, meets one of the other exceptions in this subsection (13) and subsections (14) and (15) of this section.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(14) In a county with a population of more than six hundred thousand inhabitants or in a county with a population of at least two hundred forty-five thousand inhabitants that borders Puget Sound as defined in RCW  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=90.71.010\">90.71.010</a>, the compensating tax specified in subsection (11) of this section may not be imposed if the removal of designation as forestland under subsection (5) of this section resulted solely from:</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(a) An action described in subsection (13) of this section; or</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(b) A transfer of a property interest to a government entity, or to a nonprofit historic preservation corporation or nonprofit nature conservancy corporation, as defined in RCW  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=64.04.130\">64.04.130</a>, to protect or enhance public resources, or to preserve, maintain, improve, restore, limit the future use of, or otherwise to conserve for public use or enjoyment, the property interest being transferred.

The legislature further finds that farmland and timberland in urbanizing areas are often subjected to high levels of property taxation and benefit assessment, and that such levels of taxation and assessment encourage and even force the removal of such lands from agricultural and forest uses. The legislature further finds that because of this level of taxation and assessment, such farmland and timberland in urbanizing areas are either converted to nonagricultural and nonforest uses when significant amounts of nearby nonagricultural and nonforest area could be suitably used for such nonagricultural and nonforest uses, or, much of this farmland and timberland is left in an unused state. The legislature further finds that with the approval by the voters of the Fifty-third Amendment to the state Constitution, and with the enactment of chapter  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=84.34\">84.34</a> RCW, the owners of farmlands and timberlands were provided with an opportunity to have such land valued on the basis of its current use and not its \"highest and best use\" and that such current use valuation is one mechanism to protect agricultural and timberlands.

It is the intent of the legislature that special benefit assessments not be imposed for the availability of sanitary and/or storm sewerage service, or domestic water service, or for road construction and/or improvement purposes on farm and agricultural lands and timberlands which have been designated for current use classification as farm and agricultural lands or timberlands until such lands are withdrawn or removed from such classification or unless such lands benefit from or cause the need for the local improvement district.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(3) The legislature finds, and it is the intent of RCW  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=84.34.300\">84.34.300</a> through  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=84.34.380\">84.34.380</a> and  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=84.34.922\">84.34.922</a>, that special benefit assessments for the improvement or construction of sanitary and/or storm sewerage service, or domestic water service, or certain road construction do not generally benefit land which has been classified as farm and agricultural land or timberland under the open space act, chapter  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=84.34\">84.34</a> RCW, until such land is withdrawn or removed from such classification.

The appraisal must also take into account: (i) In the use of sales by real estate contract as similar sales, the extent, if any, to which the stated selling price has been increased by reason of the down payment, interest rate, or other financing terms; and (ii) the extent to which the sale of a similar property actually represents the general effective market demand for property of such type, in the geographical area in which such property is located.

Consideration should be given to any agreement, between an owner of rental housing and any government agency, that restricts rental income, appreciation, and liquidity; and to the impact of government restrictions on operating expenses and on ownership rights in general of such housing. In the case of property of a complex nature, or being used under terms of a franchise from a public agency, or operating as a public utility, or property not having a record of sale within five years and not having a significant number of sales of similar property in the general area, the provisions of this subsection must be the dominant factors in valuation.

The highest and best use of timberlands, whether cut-over, selectively harvested, or containing merchantable or immature timber, is to manage, protect and harvest them in a manner which will realize the greatest economic value and assure the maximum continuous supply of forest products. This requires that merchantable timber originally on timberlands be harvested gradually to maintain a continuous supply until immature timber reaches the optimum age or size for harvesting, that immature timber on timberlands be managed and protected for extensive periods until it reaches such optimum age or size and that such timberlands be continually restocked as harvested.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(8) Reforestation entails an integrated forest management program which includes gradual harvesting of existing merchantable timber, management and protection of immature timber during its growth cycle until it reaches the optimum size or age for harvesting and a continual preparation and restocking of areas after harvest. Such management of timberlands is now generally followed and practiced in this state and it is in the public interest that such management be continued and encouraged.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(9) The prices at which merchantable timber is sold generally reflect values based upon immediate harvesting, and the prices at which both merchantable and immature timber are sold frequently reflect circumstances peculiar to the particular purchaser. Such prices generally make little or no allowance for the continuous and accumulative burdens of taxes, protection, management costs, interest on investment, and risks of loss from fire, insects, disease, and the elements which must be borne by the owner of timberlands over long periods of time prior to the time timber is harvested and income is realized. Such prices do not, therefore, provide a reliable measure of the true and fair value in money. Accordingly, both the public policy and the public interest of this state and sound principles of timber valuation require that in the determination of the true and fair value in money of such properties appropriate and full allowance be made for such continuous and accumulative burdens over the period of time between assessment and harvest.</div>",
