When a district provides a real property owner or the owner's designee with duplicates of tenant utility service bills or notice that a tenant's utility account is delinquent, the district shall notify the tenant that it is providing the duplicate bills or delinquency notice to the owner or the owner's designee. After January 1, 1999, if a board fails to notify the owner of a tenant's delinquency after receiving a written request to do so and after receiving the other information required by this subsection (8), the board shall have no lien against the premises for the tenant's delinquent and unpaid charges.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(9) The court may allow, in addition to the costs and disbursements provided by statute, such attorneys' fees as it may adjudge reasonable.

A local improvement district may include adjoining, vicinal, or neighboring improvements even though the improvements and the properties benefited are not connected or continuous. Such improvements may be owned by the United States, the state of Washington, the irrigation district, or another local government. Upon approval of the board of an adjoining irrigation district, an irrigation district may form local improvement districts or utility local improvement districts that are composed entirely or in part of territory within that adjoining district. Upon the filing of the petition the board, with the assistance of a competent engineer, shall make an investigation of the feasibility, cost, and need of the proposed local improvement together with the ability of the lands to pay the cost, and if it appears feasible, they may elect to have plans and an estimate of the cost prepared. If a protest against the establishment of the proposed improvement signed by a majority of the holders of title in the proposed local district is presented at or before the hearing, or if the proposed improvement should be found not feasible, too expensive, or not in the best interest of the district, or the lands to be benefited insufficient security for the costs, they shall dismiss the petition.</div>",
