The law enforcement officer shall take possession of all firearms, dangerous weapons, and any concealed pistol license belonging to the respondent that are surrendered, in plain sight, or discovered pursuant to a lawful search. If the order is entered in open court and the respondent appears in person, the respondent shall be provided a copy and further service is not required. If the respondent refuses to receive a copy, an agent of the court may indicate on the record that the respondent refused to receive a copy of the order. If the respondent appears remotely for the hearing, or leaves the hearing before a final ruling is issued or order signed, and the court believes the respondent has sufficient notice such that additional service is not necessary, the order must recite that the respondent appeared before the court, has actual notice of the order, the necessity for further service is waived, and proof of service of the order is not necessary. The court shall enter the service and receipt into the record. A copy of the order and service shall be transmitted immediately to law enforcement. The respondent must immediately surrender all firearms, dangerous weapons, and any concealed pistol license in a safe manner to the control of the local law enforcement agency on the day of the hearing at which the respondent was present in person or remotely. Alternatively, if personal service by a law enforcement officer is not possible, and the respondent did not appear in person or remotely at the hearing, the respondent shall surrender the firearms in a safe manner to the control of the local law enforcement agency within 24 hours of being served with the order by alternate service.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(3) At the time of surrender, a law enforcement officer taking possession of firearms, dangerous weapons, and any concealed pistol license shall issue a receipt identifying all firearms, dangerous weapons, and any concealed pistol license that have been surrendered and provide a copy of the receipt to the respondent. The law enforcement agency shall file the original receipt with the court within 24 hours after service of the order and retain a copy of the receipt, electronically whenever electronic filing is available.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(4) Upon the sworn statement or testimony of the petitioner or of any law enforcement officer alleging that the respondent has failed to comply with the surrender of firearms or dangerous weapons as required by an order issued under RCW  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.800\">9.41.800</a> or  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=10.99.100\">10.99.100</a>, the court shall determine whether probable cause exists to believe that the respondent has failed to surrender all firearms and dangerous weapons in their possession, custody, or control.

For any case where the court has indication that the respondent has in the respondent's possession, custody, or control firearms, dangerous weapons, or a concealed pistol license, a compliance review hearing shall be held. A compliance review hearing may be waived by the court or held at a later date if the information attested to by the person subject to the order, along with verification from law enforcement and any other relevant evidence, makes a sufficient showing that the person has timely and completely surrendered all firearms and dangerous weapons in the person's custody, control, or possession, and any concealed pistol license issued under RCW  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.070\">9.41.070</a>, to a law enforcement agency, and the court is able to make a finding of compliance.

Law enforcement shall also serve a copy of the order to show cause on the petitioner, either electronically or in person, at no cost.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(c) The order to show cause served upon the respondent shall state the date, time, and location of the hearing and shall include a warning that the respondent may be held in contempt of court if the respondent fails to promptly comply with the terms of the order to surrender and prohibit weapons and a warning that an arrest warrant could be issued if the respondent fails to appear on the date and time provided in the order.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(d)(i) At the show cause hearing, the respondent must be present and provide proof of compliance with the underlying court order to surrender and prohibit weapons and demonstrate why the relief requested should not be granted.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(ii) The court shall take judicial notice of the receipt filed with the court by the law enforcement agency pursuant to subsection (3) of this section. The court shall also provide sufficient notice to the law enforcement agency of the hearing. Upon receiving notice pursuant to this subsection, a law enforcement agency must:</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(A) Provide the court with a complete list of firearms and other dangerous weapons surrendered by the respondent or otherwise belonging to the respondent that are in the possession of the law enforcement agency; and</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(B) Provide the court with verification that any concealed pistol license issued to the respondent has been surrendered and an agency with authority to revoke the license has been notified.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(iii) If the law enforcement agency has a reasonable suspicion that the respondent is not in full compliance with the terms of the order, the law enforcement agency must submit the basis for its belief to the court, and may do so through the filing of a declaration.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(e) If the court finds the respondent in contempt, the court may impose remedial sanctions designed to ensure swift compliance with the order to surrender and prohibit weapons.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(f) The court may order a respondent found in contempt of the order to surrender and prohibit weapons to pay for any losses incurred by a party in connection with the contempt proceeding, including reasonable attorneys' fees, service fees, and other costs.

Such appearance does not constitute the unauthorized practice of law.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(9)(a) The act of voluntarily surrendering firearms or weapons, providing testimony relating to the surrender of firearms or weapons, or complying with an order to surrender and prohibit weapons issued pursuant to RCW  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.800\">9.41.800</a> or  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=10.99.100\">10.99.100</a>, and any information directly or indirectly derived from such act or testimony, may not be used against the person subject to the order in any criminal prosecution under this chapter, chapter  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=7.105\">7.105</a> RCW, or RCW  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9A.56.310\">9A.56.310</a>, or in any criminal prosecution pursuant to which such order to surrender and prohibit weapons was issued, except a prosecution for perjury, giving a false statement, or otherwise failing to comply with the order. Every such order issued subsequent to July 23, 2023, shall contain language consistent with the statutory immunity set forth in this subsection.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(b) If a person subject to such an order invokes the privilege against self-incrimination at the time of issuance of the order or at a subsequent hearing, the court may afford the person subject to the order an opportunity to demonstrate that compliance with the surrender provision of the order would expose that person to a realistic threat of self-incrimination in a subsequent or pending criminal proceeding. The court may conduct this portion of the proceeding ex parte or receive evidence in camera, without the presence of the prosecuting attorney, after the court conducts an analysis under <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">State v. Bone-Club</span>, 128 wn.2d 254, and concludes that the courtroom may be closed.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(c) If the person subject to the order establishes such a realistic threat of self-incrimination regarding possible criminal prosecution that is not addressed by the immunity from prosecution set forth in (a) of this subsection, the court shall afford the relevant prosecuting attorney an opportunity to offer an immunity agreement tailored specifically to the firearms or weapons implicated by the potential self-incrimination. To achieve the purposes of this section, any immunity offered should be narrowly tailored to address any realistic threat of self-incrimination while ensuring that any other firearms not implicated are surrendered.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(d) Any immunity from prosecution beyond the immunity set forth in (a) of this subsection, may only be extended by the prosecuting attorney. If the prosecuting attorney declines to extend immunity such that the person subject to the order cannot fully comply with its surrender provision without facing a realistic threat of self-incrimination, the court's order must provide for the surrender of every firearm, dangerous weapon, and concealed pistol license that does not implicate a realistic threat of self-incrimination. The order's prohibitions regarding accessing, purchasing, receiving, or attempting to purchase or receive, any firearms or other dangerous weapons, or concealed pistol license, remain in effect.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(e) Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as diminishing the requirement that the person subject to the order fully comply with the order issued by the court. The burden remains on the person subject to the order to prove compliance.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(10) To provide relevant information to the court to determine compliance with the order, the court may allow the prosecuting attorney or city attorney to question the respondent regarding compliance.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(11) All law enforcement agencies must have policies and procedures to provide for the acceptance, storage, and return of firearms, dangerous weapons, and concealed pistol licenses that a court requires must be surrendered under RCW  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.800\">9.41.800</a>.

Real property seized under this section may not be transferred or otherwise conveyed until ninety days after seizure or until a judgment of forfeiture is entered, whichever is later, but real property seized under this section may be transferred or conveyed to any person or entity who acquires title by foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure of a bona fide security interest.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(b) Seizure of personal property without process may be made if:</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(i) The seizure is incident to an arrest or a search under a search warrant or an inspection under an administrative inspection warrant;</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(ii) The property subject to seizure has been the subject of a prior judgment in favor of the state in a criminal injunction or forfeiture proceeding based upon this chapter;</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(iii) A law enforcement officer has probable cause to believe that the property is directly or indirectly dangerous to health or safety; or</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(iv) The law enforcement officer has probable cause to believe that the property was used or is intended to be used in violation of this chapter.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(3) In the event of seizure under subsection (2) of this section, proceedings for forfeiture are deemed commenced by the seizure. The law enforcement agency under whose authority the seizure was made shall cause notice to be served within fifteen days following the seizure on the owner of the property seized and the person in charge thereof and any person having any known right or interest therein, including any community property interest, of the seizure and intended forfeiture of the seized property. Service of notice of seizure of real property must be made according to the rules of civil procedure. However, the state may not obtain a default judgment with respect to real property against a party who is served by substituted service absent an affidavit stating that a good faith effort has been made to ascertain if the defaulted party is incarcerated within the state, and that there is no present basis to believe that the party is incarcerated within the state. Notice of seizure in the case of property subject to a security interest that has been perfected by filing a financing statement in accordance with chapter 62A.9A RCW, or a certificate of title, must be made by service upon the secured party or the secured party's assignee at the address shown on the financing statement or the certificate of title. The notice of seizure in other cases may be served by any method authorized by law or court rule including but not limited to service by certified mail with return receipt requested. Service by mail is deemed complete upon mailing within the fifteen-day period following the seizure.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(4) If no person notifies the seizing law enforcement agency in writing of the person's claim of ownership or right to possession of items specified in subsection (1) of this section within forty-five days of the seizure in the case of personal property and ninety days in the case of real property, the item seized is deemed forfeited. The community property interest in real property of a person whose spouse or domestic partner committed a violation giving rise to seizure of the real property may not be forfeited if the person did not participate in the violation.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(5) If any person notifies the seizing law enforcement agency in writing of the person's claim of ownership or right to possession of items specified in subsection (1) of this section within forty-five days of the seizure in the case of personal property and ninety days in the case of real property, the person or persons must be afforded a reasonable opportunity to be heard as to the claim or right. The hearing must be before the chief law enforcement officer of the seizing agency or the chief law enforcement officer's designee, except if the seizing agency is a state agency as defined in RCW  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=34.12.020\">34.12.020</a>(4), the hearing must be before the chief law enforcement officer of the seizing agency or an administrative law judge appointed under chapter  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=34.12\">34.12</a> RCW, except that any person asserting a claim or right may remove the matter to a court of competent jurisdiction. Removal of any matter involving personal property may only be accomplished according to the rules of civil procedure. The person seeking removal of the matter must serve process against the state, county, political subdivision, or municipality that operates the seizing agency, and any other party of interest, in accordance with RCW  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=4.28.080\">4.28.080</a> or  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=4.92.020\">4.92.020</a>, within forty-five days after the person seeking removal has notified the seizing law enforcement agency of the person's claim of ownership or right to possession. The court to which the matter is to be removed must be the district court if the aggregate value of personal property is within the jurisdictional limit set forth in RCW  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=3.66.020\">3.66.020</a>. A hearing before the seizing agency and any appeal therefrom must be under Title <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=34\">34</a> RCW. In a court hearing between two or more claimants to the article or articles involved, the prevailing party is entitled to a judgment for costs and reasonable attorneys' fees. In cases involving personal property, the burden of producing evidence is upon the person claiming to be the lawful owner or the person claiming to have the lawful right to possession of the property. In cases involving property seized under subsection (1)(a) of this section, the only issues to be determined by the tribunal are whether the item seized is a gambling device, and whether the device is an antique device as defined by RCW  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.46.235\">9.46.235</a>. In cases involving real property, the burden of producing evidence is upon the law enforcement agency. The burden of proof that the seized real property is subject to forfeiture is upon the law enforcement agency. The seizing law enforcement agency shall promptly return the article or articles to the claimant upon a final determination by the administrative law judge or court that the claimant is the present lawful owner or is lawfully entitled to possession thereof of items specified in subsection (1) of this section.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(6) If property is forfeited under this chapter the seizing law enforcement agency may:</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(a) Retain it for official use or upon application by any law enforcement agency of this state release the property to the agency for training or use in enforcing this chapter;</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(b) Sell that which is not required to be destroyed by law and which is not harmful to the public; or</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(c) Destroy any articles that may not be lawfully possessed within the state of Washington, or that have a fair market value of less than one hundred dollars.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(7)(a) If property is forfeited, the seizing agency shall keep a record indicating the identity of the prior owner, if known, a description of the property, the disposition of the property, the value of the property at the time of seizure, and the amount of proceeds realized from disposition of the property. The net proceeds of forfeited property is the value of the forfeitable interest in the property after deducting the cost of satisfying any bona fide security interest to which the property is subject at the time of seizure, and in the case of sold property, after deducting the cost of sale, including reasonable fees or commissions paid to independent selling agents.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(b) Each seizing agency shall retain records of forfeited property for at least seven years.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(8) The seizing law enforcement agency shall retain forfeited property and net proceeds exclusively for the expansion and improvement of gambling-related law enforcement activity. Money retained under this section may not be used to supplant preexisting funding sources.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(9) Gambling devices that are possessed, transferred, sold, or offered for sale in violation of this chapter are contraband and must be seized and summarily forfeited to the state. Gambling equipment that is seized or comes into the possession of a law enforcement agency, the owners of which are unknown, are contraband and must be summarily forfeited to the state.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(10) Upon the entry of an order of forfeiture of real property, the court shall forward a copy of the order to the assessor of the county in which the property is located. The superior court shall enter orders for the forfeiture of real property, subject to court rules. The seizing agency shall file such an order in the county auditor's records in the county in which the real property is located.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(11)(a) A landlord may assert a claim against proceeds from the sale of assets seized and forfeited under subsection (6)(b) of this section, only if:</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(i) A law enforcement officer, while acting in his or her official capacity, directly caused damage to the complaining landlord's property while executing a search of a tenant's residence; and</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(ii) The landlord has applied any funds remaining in the tenant's deposit, to which the landlord has a right under chapter  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=59.18\">59.18</a> RCW, to cover the damage directly caused by a law enforcement officer before asserting a claim under this section.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(A) Only if the funds applied under (a)(ii) of this subsection are insufficient to satisfy the damage directly caused by a law enforcement officer, may the landlord seek compensation for the damage by filing a claim against the governmental entity under whose authority the law enforcement agency operates within thirty days after the search; and</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(B) Only if the governmental entity denies or fails to respond to the landlord's claim within sixty days of the date of filing, may the landlord collect damages under this subsection by filing within thirty days of denial or the expiration of the sixty-day period, whichever occurs first, a claim with the seizing law enforcement agency. The seizing law enforcement agency shall notify the landlord of the status of the claim by the end of the thirty-day period. This section does not require the claim to be paid by the end of the sixty-day or thirty-day period.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(b) For any claim filed under (a)(ii) of this subsection, the law enforcement agency shall pay the claim unless the agency provides substantial proof that the landlord either:</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(i) Knew or consented to actions of the tenant in violation of this chapter; or</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(ii) Failed to respond to a notification of the illegal activity, provided by a law enforcement agency within seven days of receipt of notification of the illegal activity.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(12) The landlord's claim for damages under subsection (11) of this section may not include a claim for loss of business and is limited to:</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(a) Damage to tangible property and clean-up costs;</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(b) The lesser of the cost of repair or fair market value of the damage directly caused by a law enforcement officer;</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(c) The proceeds from the sale of the specific tenant's property seized and forfeited under subsection (6)(b) of this section; and</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(d) The proceeds available after the seizing law enforcement agency satisfies any bona fide security interest in the tenant's property and costs related to sale of the tenant's property as provided by subsection (7)(a) of this section.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(13) Subsections (11) and (12) of this section do not limit any other rights a landlord may have against a tenant to collect for damages.

Sutherby</span>, 204 P.3d 916 (2009), the unit of prosecution for the statutes governing possession of and dealing in depictions of a minor engaged in sexually explicit conduct. It is the intent of the legislature that the first degree offenses under RCW  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.68A.050\">9.68A.050</a>,  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.68A.060\">9.68A.060</a>, and  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.68A.070\">9.68A.070</a> have a per depiction or image unit of prosecution, while the second degree offenses under RCW  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.68A.050\">9.68A.050</a>,  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.68A.060\">9.68A.060</a>, and  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.68A.070\">9.68A.070</a> have a per incident unit of prosecution as established in <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">State v. Sutherby</span>, 204 P.3d 916 (2009). Furthermore, it is the intent of the legislature to set a different unit of prosecution for the new offense of viewing of depictions of a minor engaged in sexually explicit conduct such that each separate session of intentionally viewing over the internet of visual depictions or images of a minor engaged in sexually explicit conduct constitutes a separate offense.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">The decisions of the Washington supreme court in <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">State v. Boyd</span>, 160 W.2d 424, 158 P.3d 54 (2007), and <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">State v. Grenning</span>, 169 Wn.2d 47, 234 P.3d 169 (2010), require prosecutors to duplicate and distribute depictions of a minor engaged in sexually explicit conduct (\"child pornography\") as part of the discovery process in a criminal prosecution. The legislature finds that the importance of protecting children from repeat exploitation in child pornography is not being given sufficient weight under these decisions. The importance of protecting children from repeat exploitation in child pornography is based upon the following findings:</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(1) Child pornography is not entitled to protection under the First Amendment and thus may be prohibited;</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(2) The state has a compelling interest in protecting children from those who sexually exploit them, and this interest extends to stamping out the vice of child pornography at all levels in the distribution chain;</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(3) Every instance of viewing images of child pornography represents a renewed violation of the privacy of the victims and a repetition of their abuse;</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(4) Child pornography constitutes prima facie contraband, and as such should not be distributed to, or copied by, child pornography defendants or their attorneys;</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(5) It is imperative to prohibit the reproduction of child pornography in criminal cases so as to avoid repeated violation and abuse of victims, so long as the government makes reasonable accommodations for the inspection, viewing, and examination of such material for the purposes of mounting a criminal defense. The legislature is also aware that the Adam Walsh child protection and safety act, P.L. 109–248, 120 Stat. 587 (2006), codified at 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3509(m), prohibits the duplication and distribution of child pornography as part of the discovery process in federal prosecutions. This federal law has been in effect since 2006, and upheld repeatedly as constitutional. Courts interpreting the Walsh act have found that such limitations can be employed while still providing the defendant due process. The legislature joins congress, and the legislatures of other states that have passed similar provisions, in protecting these child victims so that our justice system does not cause repeat exploitation, while still providing due process to criminal defendants.</div>",

Upon receipt of a petition from the department of labor and industries, the court shall hold a restitution hearing and shall enter a restitution order.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(8) In addition to any sentence that may be imposed, an offender who has been found guilty of an offense involving fraud or other deceptive practice or an organization which has been found guilty of any such offense may be ordered by the sentencing court to give notice of the conviction to the class of persons or to the sector of the public affected by the conviction or financially interested in the subject matter of the offense by mail, by advertising in designated areas or through designated media, or by other appropriate means.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(9) This section does not limit civil remedies or defenses available to the victim, survivors of the victim, or offender including support enforcement remedies for support ordered under subsection (6) of this section for a child born as a result of a rape of a child victim. The court shall identify in the judgment and sentence the victim or victims entitled to restitution and what amount is due each victim. The state or victim may enforce the court-ordered restitution in the same manner as a judgment in a civil action. Restitution collected through civil enforcement must be paid through the registry of the court and must be distributed proportionately according to each victim's loss when there is more than one victim.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(10) If a person has caused a victim to lose money or property through the filing of a vehicle report of sale in which the designated buyer had no knowledge of the vehicle transfer or the fraudulent filing of the report of sale, upon conviction or when the offender pleads guilty and agrees with the prosecutor's recommendation that the offender be required to pay restitution to a victim, the court may order the defendant to pay an amount, fixed by the court, not to exceed double the amount of the defendant's gain or victim's loss from the filing of the vehicle report of sale in which the designated buyer had no knowledge of the vehicle transfer or the fraudulent filing of the report of sale. Such an amount may be used to provide restitution to the victim at the order of the court. It is the duty of the prosecuting attorney to investigate the alternative of restitution, and to recommend it to the court, when the prosecuting attorney believes that restitution is appropriate and feasible. If the court orders restitution, the court must make a finding as to the amount of the victim's loss due to the filing of the report of sale in which the designated buyer had no knowledge of the vehicle transfer or the fraudulent filing of the report of sale, and if the record does not contain sufficient evidence to support such finding, the court may conduct a hearing upon the issue. For purposes of this section, \"loss\" refers to the amount of money or the value of property or services lost.</div>",

An offender being indigent as defined in RCW  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=10.01.160\">10.01.160</a>(3) is not grounds for failing to impose restitution, subject to RCW  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.94A.750\">9.94A.750</a>(3) and  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.94A.753\">9.94A.753</a>(3). The court must on either the judgment and sentence or on a subsequent order to pay, designate the total amount of a legal financial obligation and segregate this amount among the separate assessments made for restitution, costs, fines, and other assessments required by law. On the same order, the court is also to set a sum that the offender is required to pay on a monthly basis towards satisfying the legal financial obligation. If the court fails to set the offender monthly payment amount, the department shall set the amount if the department has active supervision of the offender, otherwise the county clerk shall set the amount.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(2) Upon receipt of each payment made by or on behalf of an offender, the county clerk shall distribute the payment in the following order of priority until satisfied:</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(a) First, proportionally to restitution to victims that have not been fully compensated from other sources;</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(b) Second, proportionally to restitution to insurance or other sources with respect to a loss that has provided compensation to victims;</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(c) Third, proportionally to crime victims' assessments that have not been waived under RCW  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=7.68.035\">7.68.035</a>; and</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(d) Fourth, proportionally to costs, fines, and other assessments required by law.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(3) If the court determines that the offender, at the time of sentencing, has the means to pay for the cost of incarceration, the court may require the offender to pay for the cost of incarceration.

Restitution collected through civil enforcement must be paid through the registry of the court and must be distributed proportionately according to each victim's loss when there is more than one victim.

Prior to the expiration of the initial 10-year period, the superior court may extend the criminal judgment an additional 10 years for payment of restitution obligations. All other restitution obligations for an offense committed on or after July 1, 2000, may be enforced at any time the offender remains under the court's jurisdiction. For an offense committed on or after July 1, 2000, the court shall retain jurisdiction over the offender, for purposes of the offender's compliance with payment of the restitution obligations, until the obligation is completely satisfied, regardless of the statutory maximum for the crime.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(d) All other legal financial obligations other than restitution may be enforced at any time during the 10-year period following the offender's release from total confinement or within 10 years of entry of the judgment and sentence, whichever period ends later. Prior to the expiration of the initial 10-year period, the superior court may extend the criminal judgment an additional 10 years for payment of nonrestitution legal financial obligations only if the court finds that the offender has the current or likely future ability to pay the obligations.

The county clerk is authorized to collect unpaid legal financial obligations at any time the offender remains under the jurisdiction of the court for purposes of his or her legal financial obligations.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(6) In order to assist the court in setting a monthly sum that the offender must pay during the period of supervision, the offender is required to report to the department for purposes of preparing a recommendation to the court. When reporting, the offender is required, under oath, to respond truthfully and honestly to all questions concerning present, past, and future earning capabilities and the location and nature of all property or financial assets. The offender is further required to bring all documents requested by the department.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(7) After completing the investigation, the department shall make a report to the court on the amount of the monthly payment that the offender should be required to make towards a satisfied legal financial obligation.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(8)(a) During the period of supervision, the department may make a recommendation to the court that the offender's monthly payment schedule be modified so as to reflect a change in financial circumstances.

If the county clerk sets the monthly payment amount, or if the department set the monthly payment amount and the department has subsequently turned the collection of the legal financial obligation over to the county clerk, the clerk may modify the monthly payment amount without the matter being returned to the court. During the period of repayment, the county clerk may require the offender to report to the clerk for the purpose of reviewing the appropriateness of the collection schedule for the legal financial obligation. During this reporting, the offender is required under oath to respond truthfully and honestly to all questions concerning earning capabilities and the location and nature of all property or financial assets. The offender shall bring all documents requested by the county clerk in order to prepare the collection schedule.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(9) After the judgment and sentence or payment order is entered, the department is authorized, for any period of supervision, to collect the legal financial obligation from the offender. Subsequent to any period of supervision or, if the department is not authorized to supervise the offender in the community, the county clerk is authorized to collect unpaid legal financial obligations from the offender. Any amount collected by the department shall be remitted daily to the county clerk for the purpose of disbursements. The department and the county clerks are authorized, but not required, to accept credit cards as payment for a legal financial obligation, and any costs incurred related to accepting credit card payments shall be the responsibility of the offender.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(10) The department or any obligee of the legal financial obligation may seek a mandatory wage assignment for the purposes of obtaining satisfaction for the legal financial obligation pursuant to RCW  <a href=\"http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.94A.7701\">9.94A.7701</a>.
